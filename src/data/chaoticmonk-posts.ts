      "Depends how one looks at it. Financially? not at all. \n\nI got into the financial world by delving around $GME reading DDs on r/wsb on how a hedge fund was deliberately bringing down a beloved game company by shorting its stocks which they never owned. And how a bunch of degenerates on the internet rallied against them to, somewhat, a victory. That was ultra-inspiring for me. \n\nAnd that was the perfect gateway drug for me into crypto. Crypto is transparent, open, and fair which brought its own challenges but at the end of the day - you decide your own fate. It is liberating, that\u0027s why I suppose we are all here (of course including the gains)\n\nNow that the ETF is approved, this brings a perceived legitimacy and surely a lot of money inflow, and that is great (numba must go up) but at the end of the day, these institutions would end up being whales. Off-chain, non-transparent, ruthless whales, who will do anything to extract every bit of value from the market. \nFor instance, BTC now has 11 different kinds of wrappers in the TradFi, obscured and none of which represent the real BTC price ticker. \nBTC was born off of these deceitful tradFi practices after 2008, as a beacon against it, and ironically (in its victory) ended up in the same hands. \nTradFi has a lot to learn from Defi and not the other way around. Time will tell though. \n\nSorry for the long, somewhat irrelevant answer, but I had this bittersweet feeling about the ETF and your comment was the perfect prompt to let it out.",

      "`Foto a Day #58`\n\nGrowing up, I was surrounded by people who didn\u0027t value photography as a career or hobby. In my community, the focus was on getting good grades and securing a well-paying job at a reputable firm. Photography was seen as a distraction from these goals rather than a viable pursuit.\n\nHowever, I always felt drawn towards that feeling of creating something out of a moment. I started out using my phone camera, and it was only about three years ago that I finally invested in a proper camera. It was probably one of the best decisions of my life - it was an acknowledgment towards that inner need to create something and that it needs to be taken seriously.  \n\nThis photograph is from about a decade ago, one of the first compositions I attempted and edited. It serves as a reminder that, when given a choice between comfort and excitement, I should always choose the latter. \n\nüìçShimla, India \n\n50 Editions\n0.5 WMATIC\nMirror Referral - 25%\nFollowers-only\n\n#LMCC #photography @creators @photographers #lensport #lenster #FotoADay",

      'IMO a very important discussion and glad you brought it up Jessy üôåüèΩ\nHere\u0027s how I look at it, solely from the context of social media where one communicates using text and media:\n1. My freedom of expression should not override anyone else\u0027s, no matter how different their views are from mine. \n2. My freedom of expression allows me to counter any views/opinions which I find wrong with my full might. There could be two results here, either, I convince the other party how ridiculous their points are, or I learn something new. \n\n*However, things don\u0027t usually go this way, it usually ends up with name-calling etc..* \nAnd therefore, \n3.  I reserve the right of stopping any communication with someone who retorts to petty word fights or slandering. \n\nThe thing about \u0027Morals\u0027 and \u0027Ethics\u0027 is that over a course of time, they change, for eg -  there are plenty of people who spent their entire lives in prison because marijuana was, at a time considered immoral, and detested by society as a sinful thing. In those days, people thought they were \u0027protecting\u0027 society from smokers; *"How the turn tables"*  \nthere are many such examples. \n\nAlso, a little off-topic but I feel it\u0027s necessary to mention here: The only censorship that is possible and rational is self-censorship or in small groups - Parents monitoring what their kids are on about is way easier and more effective than controlling an entire batch of students in a school. Any other kind of mass censorship leads to usually riots ( also, there is no decentralized way to do so imo). I know it\u0027s not the point of your post, but censoring things doesn\u0027t work over a long period of time, ever, and sets a bad precedent for solving problems through censorship instead of dialogue. \n\nTo answer your question *":what if people start sharing sexist, antisemitist, racist and all sort of ‚Äúimmoral and unethical‚Äù ideas/contents?!"*\n- I\u0027d counter it, if it means so much to me I\u0027ll counter it with all my might using text (and memes, of course) while not name-calling /labeling them anything. At the same time, I\u0027ll be walking away if the other person starts talking shit or starts attacking, that\u0027s where I (and others who will read it) will know that this person is BSing. The same goes the other way around if I\u0027m stupid enough to slander. \n\nWe\u0027re lost the art of dialogue while being respectful. We started relying on a 3rd party as a proxy to solve it for us. Most Humans aren\u0027t full of evil, we just don\u0027t know them enough yet. \nMuch Love üíö',

They are citizen journalists and get plenty of engagement without clickbait content and people who get value out of it pay them (transparent over blockchain)\n\nAlso, it\u0027s not clickbait if they actually talk/write about the topic, and if that\u0027s not the case people will eventually flock away. \n\n- It‚Äôs a question of attention - to which audience would you like to appeal? Make content FOR them. Personally, I would rigorously read/watch about things I\u0027m interested in and glance over things that I\u0027m not. \n\n- Agreed. And they cannot be verified as mostly there are no sources, just opinions. \n\n- Two points here \n\n\t1. Do we really need to go through a training to document/journal the present? Historians try to capture what happened based on looking at murals and encrypted writing on a wall whereas we are preserving the present for the future by having these open dialogues and discussions which will always have an imprint over a blockchain. I\u0027m not saying it‚Äôs the absolute truth, but capture enough (verifiable) discussions, and the future civilization will be able to understand their history. \n\n\t2. Uploading web2 credentials to a wallet - I\u0027m not well-informed here. Perhaps a centralized issuer for \u0027NFT of credibility\u0027?\n\nIMHO it\u0027s not about the credentials, you could be an anon, it\u0027s about the content you deliver - people don\u0027t have to trust, but verify you - which can be done on Web3.",

If a certain level of convenience neutralizes sadness ( or anything we don\u0027t want to feel), then we wouldn\u0027t desire to be happy to begin with, and would live in a constant state of tranquility, which is obviously not the case.  \nAnd yes, given the convenience, we def have a better chance to ponder over these things which earlier would not be even in the top 10 priority. \n\n\nThanks for the rec; I\u0027ll check out the book. üôåüèΩ",

It does not matter how others perceive it; they may appreciate it or overlook it. What matters is if the art had a genuine intention and meaning for the creator, then it has already fulfilled its purpose. \nGoing beyond visual arts, the same could be said for a scientist, a leader, or anything which involves human creativity. And this is probably why \u0027true artists\u0027 and thinkers are often misunderstood at their time, for what they created, the society didn\u0027t relate to (or wasn\u0027t ready for)\n\n\nWhen art is created with the intention of being consumed (although there is nothing wrong with this), it may lose its depth and meaning. And while it may still serve other purposes, it\u0027s questionable to me whether we can still consider it art. \nI could be completely off about this, but this is where I\u0027m, at least for now.

      "Creating videos has been a difficult journey so far; one must convey a message by speaking + visuals. Similar yet very different to photography. \n\nSome thoughts on the process\n\n‚Ä¢\t**Scripting:** 70% of a good video depends on how well the script is crafted (including planning the A-rolls+B-rolls). The rest is just execution. Laziness is the key deterrent here, as I was not expecting video creation to be so write-intensive. \n\n`Catalyst needed- Discipline to sit down and write.` \n\n‚Ä¢\t**Shooting:** The most challenging part (for me) as I didn\u0027t feel comfortable speaking naturally to a camera. However, it got better with practice. Remember to talk as if you\u0027re telling it to your friend. \n\n`Catalyst - Practice` \n\n‚Ä¢\t**Editing:** This takes the most time, between 3-8 hours depending on the video. However, I don\u0027t mind as I enjoy this part the most. But time is a factor as, over time it becomes tiresome- The edit is no longer novel, and you grow tired of listening to yourself repeatedly. Therefore, to maximize enjoyment, one must organize ( B roll clips, sound design) to reduce the time.\n\n`Catalyst - Digital Organization` \n\n‚Ä¢\t**Thumbnails + Title:** No one clicks on the video if it‚Äôs not interesting enough - I plan a rough Title during scripting, but it changes throughout the process; Thumbnails needs a lot of practice, trial, and error. I want it to be fun, like editing photos, but that has not been the case so far. \n\n`Catalyst: Marketing + Visual Design.` \n\nOnwards..",

Hard Fact-based journalism by \u0027Autism Capital\u0027 and other anon individuals who used hard facts, which were verifiable on the blockchain. \n\nYou\u0027re right about the Doctor\u0027s example because although the economy is going online, there will always be a need for physical-world activities.

      '`Your Foto A Day #8`¬†featuring¬†@sameold.lens \n\n\n**Spread from Secret Societies - The Graphic History Of Organised Crime Book.** \nIgnazio "Jack Rizotta" Dragna, who later led the Los Angeles Crime Family, was convicted in 1915 for extortion. He was found guilty of demanding $500 under the threat of death, using letters decorated with skull and crossbones. He was sentenced to three years in San Quentin Penitentiary. Evidence introduced during his trial proved his friendship with a Mafia leader in Corleone, Sicily. \nHe was released after ten months on a legal technicality. In 1917, Dragna tried to escape Los Angeles City Jail three times in one day, after being arrested in connection with the killing of a New York poultry dealer. Much is popularised of the Mafia in film, literature, music and urban legend. Some stories are inspired by and respectful of facts, but many are presented via a creative lens distorting how organised crime began. \nReferences are often made to criminal activity in the infamous Prohibition Era, but few stories cover the preceding years. This book however examines the early development of the Sicilian-American criminal network through the rise and fall of the first USA bosses of bosses Giuseppe Morello and his powerful brother-in-law Ignazio Lupo. \nWritten and designed by Jon Black. \nPublished by @sameold.lens  \nFollow and send @sameold.lens  a DM for a chance to win a copy of the book. \n\n\n#YourFotoADay\n.....................................................................................................................\nChris is a super talented multi-disciplinary artist and you can find him on any Lens app via the Lensvert Link: https://lensvert.xyz/u/sameold\n\n\n8 Editions || 1 WMATIC || 100% of the Collect-Revenue goes to the featured artist via Multi-Wallet Collect Module üîê\n\n\nüì∏ Complete FotoADay Collection:¬†pinsta.xyz/chaoticmonk\n\n\n#LMCC¬†#photography¬†@creators¬†@photographers',

This remarkable sense of smell allows them to track wild boars from a great distance, and their muscular bodies and strong jaws enable them to subdue their quarry effectively. \nOver time, Dogo Argentinos have also been utilized for other purposes, such as search and rescue, police work, and as service dogs, showcasing their versatility and intelligence.\n\n\n#YourFotoADay\n.....................................................................................................................\nApart from being a Doggo Enthusiast, @gotenks.lens is one of the OG Lens Adopters who surfaced in the summer of 2022 on the Lens Garden.

She brought so much light and joy to my life in such a dark period in this world. I took this picture during our holidays in Switzerland, more precisely a day in which we hiked on the mountains from 1700 to 2700 meters above sea level. She was so light! Climbing and jumping with the skill of a goat among the stones. When we were arriving at the very top of the mountain I was super exhausted, all my body in pain.... I felt that I couldn\u0027t go further... However, D. was still going up and up. I looked at her and said: if she can, I can, we are both equally human beings. So, I took a deep breath and did the last part, following her steps.\nAt the summit of the mountain, we sat and I shared with her my thoughts, and how much she had inspired me to overcome my own physical and mental limits. She cried out of emotion, and I felt a extreme and super powerful happiness to be there. \nD. is not with us anymore, but I feel that I will always be able to walk with her toward the light. Do not leave neither your mind nor your body to trick you. You can do it. Just follow your path of light...\n\n\n\n#YourFotoADay \n\n\nYou can find Lufo + his amazing art and storytelling on any Lens app via the Lensvert Link below: \n\nhttps://lensvert.xyz/u/lufoart\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n100% of the Collect-Revenue goes to the featured artist via Multi-Wallet Collect Module üîê\n\n\nüì∏ Complete FotoADay Collection: pinsta.xyz/chaoticmonk \n\n\n#LMCC #photography @creators.lens @photographers.lens ",

If the goal is to onboard the next billion users, reality is that the virtues (despite being he most important aspect) alone just won\u0027t cut it. We need to deliver those virtues inside a \u0027trojan horse\u0027 of utilities that the general public would love to use.\n\ncc @lens/0xmoe @lens/superluminal',
