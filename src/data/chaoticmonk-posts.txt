 *The mere notion of a collective is the very reason individuals are miserable.  There is no collective.  There's no commonality about human beings. Each individual is unique, and it's a disgrace to that uniqueness when "society" tries to fit them in a box - towards a common goal.  The goal that serves nothing but the 'order'.  This 'Order' is a hammer that starts hammering the minds of individuals *

I claim I want it,

that elusive "it" I seek.

Yet my actions hesitate at the shore.

I know a moment will come with no space for half measures‚Äî

No mere testing of waters, no dipping of toes.

In that decisive moment,

I must plunge, not recoil,

embrace the depths,

Or live with the consequences of the "safety" of the sand.

The token would be sent to the tipped users every Friday.

Content: Were you able to do it? afaik, as @lens/jessyjeanne  mentioned, Lensport would be the only (indirect) way to do it. Seems like Hey got rid of the gating option. 

Option 1 (Lens Native) 
- Create a post with limited collects on @lens/lensport . 
- Self collect all the editions 
- Send the Editions to the desired users via Lensport. 
- Create a new Collectible Post and set the view rights to "Other Post or NFT Collectors" 


Option 2 (Gating via external NFT) 
- Similar process but here the NFT could be minted externally and then accordingly gated via Lensport. 

These are the only two ways I can think of atm, tagging @lens/jamesfinnerty @lens/punkess @lens/grams in case they know more tools or have other ideas. üí°

Content: Same - also for comments + been flagging a lot of stuff like this as low signal (on hey). Its a fine line of course, because in some cases there could be someone genuine who just doesn't want to write a lot. That being said, as an ecosystem imo we must think from the eyes of a newcomer and if they would like to engage with a particular post in question. 
Incentivise visibility to high-signal posts, which would vary on different frontends and their visibility mechanism.

For the shot I posted the shutter was open for 1 whole second which blurred out the snow. 

Posting another shot for comparison, where the shutter was open for 1/25 of a second and hence was able to capture the moving snow a bit better üòä

Content: Yesterday, for the first time I saw a massive bird migration in action right over the Frankfurt skies - did some research and its apparently The Common Crane (Grus grus) which migrate in thousands in a V-formation towards southern Europe/North Africa during winters. 

Spotted them while driving so couldn't shoot but was able to snap one through the rusty leaves during a hike. Doesn't sound much haha but it was quite the spectacle to see in person.

Content: I'm with you - my comment was just a dig on the current state of most Web2 apps where content THEY think is good for us is consistently shoved on the feed. 
As you said, YouTube is the prime example - Apart from the search thingy, it was only recently that I realized that there is a separate tab (kinda hidden) on the YouTube page where it just shows content from the people I've subscribed to. Everything else is the algo in play.

You may not be able to explain it, but you can surely feel it ‚Äì call it a gut feeling. 

The world might label you mad, especially when it's unpopular to share or talk about raw truth. 
But in the end, it's for you, and that's all that matters ‚óè

I initially wanted to token gate a wallpaper utility for you but seems like @tropee_nft.lens  doesn't allow that anymore :(  So I'd go with the old method of sharing this picture via drive: https://drive.proton.me/urls/AB0FP0PQBR#LDio2190SScE

Images are displayed in full size and frame, undistorted, without the need to open them in a separate window. Plus, it now allows for collecting directly on a desktop.

Here's a side-by-side comparison of what happens with a single click on an image in Lenster vs. Buttrfly.

I'm at most peace when I don't lie to myself. 
At that time, there's no layer of constructed ideals between me and whatever I think I may be, there's a sense of effortlessness. The feeling doesn't last though, for it takes minutes for my mind to conjure up another problem to fix or freak out about ‚öìÔ∏è

The original picture (first one) is in portrait format shot at Geierlay Suspension Bridge, Germany, and all the landscape ones were generated using Photoshop.

Would you question any of the pictures if you stumbled upon them online?

GM, excited to share that I'm collabing with @buttrfly.lens this week for a special mini Foto-Series:  "MIDDLE LANE" - Its a collection of 3 carefully curated monochrome pieces, of which I thought I'd tease some elements before the full reveal. 

The first of the three drops tomorrow on @buttrfly Mobile and Desktop app. Hope you love them as much as I do. And, hey, they might just look cooler in dark mode OR as your phone's lock screen wallpaper üòâ

Big shoutout to @0xmoe.lens for letting me continue what @jamesfinnerty.lens started with Buttrfly featured drops. I'm truly honoured üôèüèΩ

Ironies. 
Life is full of ironies, but not by its nature. The reality is unbiased, wild, and raw - one can even say true. 
But we make life conflicting, the things and moments we crave, end up consuming us, end up owing us. The pursuit becomes an unending chase and we forget what and why we started in the first place. 
This is the first of the final 10 days of FotoADay, I started this to have a sense of discipline and sincerity in the art I'm pursuing. I think I achieved it and find no reason to continue. Yet, I've become attached to the process. Without the process, I feel I have nothing. This is not good, or bad. It just is and I don't know the why of it.

I recall standing behind this waterfall - the surreal view along with the soothing sound of water cascading down, and refreshing mist settling on my skin, all created a monk-like meditative state. 
However, on the outside, I was all chaotic, shooting like a madman. Every step and every angle brought a fresh perspective, and ideas ran wild as I tried to capture them, almost as if I was flowing ü´†

This is a photograph of me (Memester) being punched in the face by my good friend Jo. This picture was taken in Koh Phangan, Thailand, where I touched grass for a few weeks in January 2023, disconnecting completely from all screens - would recommend everyone to do the same from time to time!

Content: `Foto a Day #58`

Growing up, I was surrounded by people who didn't value photography as a career or hobby. In my community, the focus was on getting good grades and securing a well-paying job at a reputable firm. Photography was seen as a distraction from these goals rather than a viable pursuit.

However, I always felt drawn towards that feeling of creating something out of a moment. I started out using my phone camera, and it was only about three years ago that I finally invested in a proper camera. It was probably one of the best decisions of my life - it was an acknowledgment towards that inner need to create something and that it needs to be taken seriously.  

This photograph is from about a decade ago, one of the first compositions I attempted and edited. It serves as a reminder that, when given a choice between comfort and excitement, I should always choose the latter.

I feel farmers are the unsung heroes of our society. When you see a farmer at work, up close and personal, it's hard not to be impressed by their dedication and skills. You can see the hard work, the tireless intensity that goes into every task, and you begin to understand the true meaning of "farm-to-table." üåø

Norms are common, 
Norms are familiar, 
Norms feel comfortable, 
Norms make one feel part of something, a sense of belonging. 
Which is ok, if one wishes for it. 
But norms never create art; for art needs a touch of crazy.
And the ones with a touch of crazy will always end up creating a category of their own. 
Be it in sports, science, visual arts, or even spirituality.  
'Being yourself' is not trite advice, it's the only way üôè

My name is Rodrigo and I'm an amateur photographer. Lately, I've been reading a lot of stuff about lifestyle medicine and longevity (I'm a cardiologist btw) and when I do I tend to come back to that pic for no reason... two random guys running at sunset. This is not a particularly special photo for me, but it kinda represents a goal I have. Anyway, I hope you like it. If you are interested in lifestyle medicine and longevity, you may want to start following me (I'm planning on starting to share what I'm learning).

On Touching Grass - We often forget the deep connection we share with nature, but the truth is, WE ARE NATURE. Like the chaotic yet captivating beauty of the natural world, we too possess a touch of unpredictability and wildness within us; while it's easy to see things in black and white, could it be that suppressing our unpredictability and wildness is the reason why we often yearn for peace and fulfillment?

Content: `Your Foto A Day #8`¬†featuring¬†@sameold.lens 


**Spread from Secret Societies - The Graphic History Of Organised Crime Book.** 
Ignazio "Jack Rizotta" Dragna, who later led the Los Angeles Crime Family, was convicted in 1915 for extortion. He was found guilty of demanding $500 under the threat of death, using letters decorated with skull and crossbones. He was sentenced to three years in San Quentin Penitentiary. Evidence introduced during his trial proved his friendship with a Mafia leader in Corleone, Sicily. 
He was released after ten months on a legal technicality. In 1917, Dragna tried to escape Los Angeles City Jail three times in one day, after being arrested in connection with the killing of a New York poultry dealer. Much is popularised of the Mafia in film, literature, music and urban legend. Some stories are inspired by and respectful of facts, but many are presented via a creative lens distorting how organised crime began. 
References are often made to criminal activity in the infamous Prohibition Era, but few stories cover the preceding years. This book however examines the early development of the Sicilian-American criminal network through the rise and fall of the first USA bosses of bosses Giuseppe Morello and his powerful brother-in-law Ignazio Lupo. 
Written and designed by Jon Black.

**The 'Chaotic' Scream** 

*Inspired By: The Scream by Edvard Munch* 

Out of all the historical art out there, 'The Scream' has always intrigued me the most. It perfectly captures the inner turmoil that we all experience at some point in our lives. I used the Midjourney tool to merge a self-portrait of mine with the digital version of the painting, to give it a more personal touch. You can find the portrait along with the digital file of 'The Scream' in the comments. It took me a few tries and revisions to strike the right balance between 'creepy' and  'too creepy', finally settled on this version.

**üìçNew Zealand**

" Road-Trippin' Living in my cozy van, I embarked on a thrilling journey across the breathtaking landscapes of New Zealand. One unforgettable morning, I awoke in my rolling abode, surrounded by snow-capped mountains and lush forests. I'd parked beside a serene, crystal-clear lake ‚Äì the perfect spot for an impromptu swim. 
We ventured together through winding roads, exploring the magical world of Middle-earth. My van-life adventure in New Zealand remains an unforgettable chapter in my book of wanderlust."

Content: I'm bearish on AI images. Although, I'm super impressed by the tech and wowed looking at how good these pictures are, but that's about it. It does not instill any sort of creativity and I disagree with the notion that a world repository of images trained by ML can surpass the human imagination. Humans def lack speed, a person can go a lifetime before they produce something they can call art, but I'd take that accomplishment anytime over prompting 100 "art" pieces in 60 seconds which I did not create.

 That being said, this is an AI image using MidJourney. Prompt- "Dystopian Germany" üôÇ

**Dogo Argentino üêæ**
A unique fact about this unique breed is that they have a heightened sensitivity to the scent of wild boar, which they were specifically bred to hunt. This remarkable sense of smell allows them to track wild boars from a great distance, and their muscular bodies and strong jaws enable them to subdue their quarry effectively. 
Over time, Dogo Argentinos have also been utilized for other purposes, such as search and rescue, police work, and as service dogs, showcasing their versatility and intelligence.

**Walking to the light 15/08/2020**
*Ch√¢teu-d'Oex, Switzerland üá®üá≠* 
During the pandemic times, the person in the picture was my girlfriend. She brought so much light and joy to my life in such a dark period in this world. I took this picture during our holidays in Switzerland, more precisely a day in which we hiked on the mountains from 1700 to 2700 meters above sea level. She was so light! Climbing and jumping with the skill of a goat among the stones. When we were arriving at the very top of the mountain I was super exhausted, all my body in pain.... I felt that I couldn't go further... However, D. was still going up and up. I looked at her and said: if she can, I can, we are both equally human beings. So, I took a deep breath and did the last part, following her steps.
At the summit of the mountain, we sat and I shared with her my thoughts, and how much she had inspired me to overcome my own physical and mental limits. She cried out of emotion, and I felt a extreme and super powerful happiness to be there. 
D. is not with us anymore, but I feel that I will always be able to walk with her toward the light. Do not leave neither your mind nor your body to trick you. You can do it. Just follow your path of light...

Content: EXPERIENCE INDIA üáÆüá≥ IN 2 MINS

India is a vibrant mix of cultures, landscapes, and traditions -  trust me, I grew up there. However for the uninitiated, it can be an overwhelming sensory explosion, and rightly so.
When asked for travel advice in India, my tip is simple: don't resist. Immerse yourself fully. Embrace the chaos, savor the myriad flavors, and let India unveil itself in its raw authenticity. You will def not like all of it, but you're guaranteed to return with a transformed view of the world.. 
This is my little attempt to capture a glimpse of it üáÆüá≥

Content: Hard No - Centrally suspending users would set a bad premise (even when done in good faith). Let the users decide what they want to see, and over time they will chose what makes sense for them. If a person wants to see bot accounts talking philosophy they have every right to see it üòÑ

On the contrary give users more options to curate their feeds, blocking, muting options. I can't emphasize this more but Muting needs to be adopted by more Lens Clients asap.

Bull Case for BONSAI: Mint/Collect/Tips/Swaps all happening within the Lens Ecosystem using BONSAI and almost all clients web/mobile offer this without any disconnect in the app UX. imo it would be a matter of how quickly the 'good tech' on Lens catches up the network effects and fast iterations of what people do and experiment with DEGEN.  

Bear Case for BONSAI: Its on Polygon.

Content: Utility > Ownership

You don't want to own things just because you can.. Ownership for its own sake is merely hoarding. While there's nothing inherently wrong with that, it doesn't solve any real problems.

I've often lauded "owning your content"  but in reality, beyond the fundamentalists, the general public doesn't prioritize it. Its a niche..
For eg: It doesn't matter if I own this post or not, until it sparks a discussion and thus serves and exhausts its utility. I understand the same cannot be applied to certain collectibles/art work/LensProfile etc. 

am I missing something? 

Oh and GM, woke up in a slightly contrarian mood. Enjoy your Sunday! ‚òïÔ∏è

Content: yea I agree with you on all points, I and many who are already here believe in the virtues owning your data. (case in point : <https://tape.xyz/watch/0x89dc-0x85> )

The general public indeed doesn't prioritise it yet and as @lens/jeanayala mentioned in another comment "that people is not even conscious about it".

Its like the saying, Decentralization and self-custody doesn't matter - Until it does.

My point is that these virtues alone cannot be the selling point but rather a side-effect of a service/utility that the general public would love to use.

For eg: I'm not a dev, but I've heard countless virtues of Linux over Windows and Mac, yet, besides the enthusiasts, the general public flock to the easier solution which solves their daily problems just as well if not better.

Which begs the question - to whom do we want to appeal to? If the goal is to onboard the next billion users, reality is that the virtues (despite being he most important aspect) alone just won't cut it. We need to deliver those virtues inside a 'trojan horse' of utilities that the general public would love to use.

Content: I feel it's like the crypto bull and bear markets, many join in during the bull run, which is okay - we do a little stress tests, see what works. 
Once the music (bonsai) stops they'd leave, which is also okay, as some might stick around. Those who want to build, will build, and those who want to create will keep creating.

Content: I prefer the term "topics" to "clubs" - easier to post into for the creator, and easier to consume content off of without being part of a 'club'.

Way less resistance for the content to flow and moderate, I hope more Lens apps would include muting topics/words which users don't want to see.

This also paves way for paywalled community/club, where only the serious could join for a fee where the value proposition of joining the club is well defined and content is strictly curated.

Im sure the video @lens/iamtherealyakuza shared covers it all. 

Just to add an anecdote - As a kid, one of the coaches gave us a tip to play FOR the team before showing how skillful you are on the ball - makes the football in general and winning way more fun for everyone. and even when one loses, its taken up as a team instead of pointing faults.

In the meantime, they have a new season of 'something' - Im speculating a new device - Kind of like Rabbit R1, nobody knows for sure.

Content: I'm usually bad in showing tough love to people I don't know too well. But this post by @lens/watchereth hits the spot. You'd be pleasantly surprised how open devs are to hear your honest feedback. 

I've been critical of Lens lately publicly as well as in person to the people I've spoken to, not because I've lost love but because I want to see it thrive, and grow towards the promise it made in 2022. 

We might see Lens going public soon, so its more important than ever to voice your concerns and feedback openly and respectfully to the people who build it. So that in turn they may build a product that we all could use.

Content: Makes me wonder myself, apart from Digital assets and Defi (which are quite niche if you think about it) what makes blockchains interesting?! 

I guess I don't know. 

I was recently pitching the value prop of NFTs to a non-web3 guy who asked if he could use it to show "proof of originality" for a particular kind of plant seeds that he grows on his farm and intends to sell. The tech is def there to do this on the blockchain- but the question is would it make more sense to do it via a quicker, much easier setup using web2 tools? 

May be the answer lies in how embedded blockchains are in our day to day lives, make them more tangible, solving "real" problems -  I don't see them there yet. 
the most tangible utility of blockchain for an avg human right now is international remittance. 

Sorry for the non-answer üòÖ

Content: Gm. Been a little away testing out different pastures. Pleasantly surprised by what the folks over ‚ÄúInterface‚Äù and ‚ÄúWarpcast‚Äù have built so far. Pros and cons to everything, but from a creator perspective Lens surely has the right setup with ‚ÄúCollects‚Äù being at the center of it.

Which makes me wonder if the likes of Zora etc and their integration on Lens is bullish or bearish for the Collects on Polygon. Perhaps an option down the line to mint Lens Collects on Zora for an even tighter integration and a wider reach while keeping the social layer on Polygon?! 

I can only speculate üôÉ

Content: My impression has been that there are a lot more active bots (engagement farming) on Web 3 socials than on Twitter. This doesn't exist on Twitter because engagement farming for airdrops isn't a thing there (scamming is). 

 
Re Follower count- imho it will remain relevant unless a certain client pushes into the other direction. For Lens is quite obvious i.e- Collects, but seems like none or the most used clients want to go there. And that, perhaps in the long run, will affect the collect volume as well, if not already. 

Of course, its not this black and white and has a lot of nuances to consider.

The proposition should not only be better but clear with a straightforward UX (Its not there yet, but def better than 3-4 years ago). 

Just like it is with money in crypto - the proposition(why) is clear - get rich quick (or broke) without the interference of a third party holding your assets. That itself is an incentive enough for people to learn the hows.

Content: Depends how one looks at it. Financially? not at all. 

I got into the financial world by delving around $GME reading DDs on r/wsb on how a hedge fund was deliberately bringing down a beloved game company by shorting its stocks which they never owned. And how a bunch of degenerates on the internet rallied against them to, somewhat, a victory. That was ultra-inspiring for me. 

And that was the perfect gateway drug for me into crypto. Crypto is transparent, open, and fair which brought its own challenges but at the end of the day - you decide your own fate. It is liberating, that's why I suppose we are all here (of course including the gains)

Now that the ETF is approved, this brings a perceived legitimacy and surely a lot of money inflow, and that is great (numba must go up) but at the end of the day, these institutions would end up being whales. Off-chain, non-transparent, ruthless whales, who will do anything to extract every bit of value from the market. 
For instance, BTC now has 11 different kinds of wrappers in the TradFi, obscured and none of which represent the real BTC price ticker. 
BTC was born off of these deceitful tradFi practices after 2008, as a beacon against it, and ironically (in its victory) ended up in the same hands. 
TradFi has a lot to learn from Defi and not the other way around. Time will tell though. 

Sorry for the long, somewhat irrelevant answer, but I had this bittersweet feeling about the ETF and your comment was the perfect prompt to let it out.

Content: Couldn't agree more with this,  I've had a hard time locating collects as an NFT outside the Lens Ecosystem (except for Buttrfly Posts with metadata, which not many utilize atm) . I'd argue that even within Lens, the UX of finding old collects is also quite difficult unless the creator/collectors take it into their own hands to curate it using Collectz or Lists on Orb or Buttrfly.  
Interoperability is technically there, but it's not easy yet to use on a mass scale.

I had plans of repurposing those posts in something else (like a giveaway etc ) . Heck, even from a POV of having a legacy V1 collect - that's not possible anymore as most of my posts and perhaps many had the 'followers only' condition set. .

Content: 1. Open it to the public (let everyone pay for their own gas or buy 'gas credits' so one doesn't have to sign every time). If a creator stumbles upon Lens on the Internet and wants to test it out, they can't. I can only speculate how many creators stumbled upon Lens but then walked away because it's not permissionless. 

2. Who is Lens actually for? IMO we need a clearer signal out in the public. Is it competing with Twitter Farcaster? Zora? Or is it in a league of its own? 
If it's creator-focused then how can they use their current work sitting on other chains on Lens or how/if they could use their Lens posts interoperably on other marketplaces?

+1 regarding contract flexibility and the wider reach. Zora is single-purpose, and surprisingly well integrated on Farcaster, just like Buttrfly and Hey. (and buying with Warps concept is quite cool)  

'Casual collects' quite frankly sounds more to me like bookmarks. I want to use Lens for minting, but now that the option exists, minting on Zora and sharing on Lens + Other Platform would give better distribution (and hence perhaps bearish for the Native Polygon Collects)

Content: By gas credit, I basically meant a self-funded dispatcher for every user, so they don't have to sign a txn for gas for every interaction on Lens. This way some people might go away because of the costs involved in using the protocol but to that I'd say paying for gas isn't a novel concept in Web3. Those who really want to stay would do so regardless and be willing to pay for it. This would be better UX and you'd be weeding out a lot more bots and airdrop farmers and increasing the overall engagement quality. 

If you say that this could be distributed (üëÄ), the qualification part is easy - users who contribute and promote the most to the network effect of the protocol +  add genuine value by **consistently** building stuff (apps, art, communities, ideas, vibes?) should surely get gas rebates/credits. 
The difficult part is drawing a line between the former and the users/bots who have activity for activity's sake - which is a big blurry line on Lens and I don't have any helpful about it. It's way easier to quantify real/fake activity on Defi using numbers, but there will always be a subjective factor when dealing with Socials.

Content: Ah yes, I've seen people do that. From what I understood, this is a specific app on Manifold that lets users only on Farcaster mint the Frame (after recasting). So you're right - anyone can potentially share the link to mint - but eventually, it uses the underlying contract. 
I'm extrapolating this by looking at this contract on OpenSea: https://opensea.io/assets/base/0x22de1eed66621e03dfd0294d7d21efffe54adad9/3 

Honestly, it's been a learning curve for me to understand all these Frames in action haha

Content: Moe mentioned in one of the comments that in the current state it isn't possible. Yet to hear from the Lens Team but I'm not too hopeful after reading Stani's response. Seems like there's a big disconnect between the people who build Lens and people who use it for posting their work.

Frankly, this convo should be happening on Lens itself, perhaps a post from¬†@lens/lens ¬†main account on the Dev Channel on¬†@lens/orbapp ¬† /¬†@lens/buttrfly ¬†or a general post would drive way more open engagement and feedback. Lots of users who actually use Lens and might have a lot of valuable feedback won't be hopping onto a different UX.
What's your opinion? What are the main things to iron out before Lens could be made open?

Content: Yes - would be great to have the option, however I'm wondering what would be the incentive for the dev building it, they could instead focus on the larger potential demographics which V2 would tend to. 
PS: I'm don't know how much effort it would be üòÑ

If we're talking ideally, would be awesome one of the more popular apps (which support collects) like @lens/buttrfly @lens/lenster could have this option because having a separate app just for V1 collects breaks the flow of Lens UX :( 

Unless, the V1 posts from this app could be embedded in V2 Lens using Open Actions üëÄ

Content: Not trying to put myself down, but I'm barely on that list.  Regarding collects, I've been always inclined to collect a 1/1 more than an Edition of 10,20, and so on. I started applying the same logic to the work that I post, which btw didn't really make a difference in the absolute collect count - because more editions always have the edge if you want more collects ( duh ) . But, I feel happier to see a single piece with a single collector who hopefully genuinely liked it. Also partly because I hold an unpopular opinion that digital art for the art's sake should only have a single edition on-chain (I think we spoke about this a few months ago on a similarly themed topic).  
I should add that my views are nothing to go by or helpful to anyone who is trying to grow their collect count

Content: Not everyone needs them back tbh, but the ones who have been trying to make Lens as a serious Web3 portfolio might have a different say. 

of course, I'm aware in the long run this is no big deal as not many would be affected, or would care, and would move on. But I would've appreciated a heads-up that "btw your posts on V1 with the 'followers only condition' won't be collectible anymore." 

I don't have the numbers, so I can only speak for myself- #FotoADay featuring 150 photographs posted over a period of 5 months is now basically a 'read only' series like any other web 2 social media platform. Most of that work can't be collected anymore as many pieces were collectible for "Followers Only" .  

Collects and the Collects Economy is THE single most important thing that we all have been excited about on Lens and the users who have been posting their work over here should've been at least made aware (if not asked) that this was gonna happen with their work. I'm sorry to say, the way this was handled (not communicated) just feels so casual.

Content: That's weird, one explanation could be that Base transactions are getting executed on Zora from the user's side and Zora then batch processes them on Base. 
BUT, I checked your txn for FR#1, and for that, it's not the case -  the txn is from your wallet itself directly minting on Base. https://basescan.org/tx/0xbffab53be26572f5be8178973606309c25571770cab63dcda3528fdb02afb563

The only difference between these two is the mint count, for FR#1 it's 21, all the others are 1/1s.

Content: The bear case for Polygon native NFTs continues. Shared some similar sentiments around this a while ago https://hey.xyz/posts/0x89dc-0x1554-DA-bf535f8d  

I've found the combo of Curation (Zora + NFT marketplaces) and distribution (open actions within Lens & Farcaster)  work very well. Unless we bring in enough distribution within the Lens ecosystem and allow some version of multi-chain collects/mints. 

But first and foremost, it's about time the Lens gates be opened for all. I'm afraid it's kind of becoming like all these L1s etc trying to build the perfect infrastructure but without much influx of new apps, it would be the same for Lens without Users in volume (and iterations the devs make based on their feedback). 

Use -> Break -> Iterate ; the sooner the better.

Also, it'd be cool to know if there's a way to figure out what they were looking at right before they leave. 
Context - I tried playing around with the feed curation on Hey but it doesn't make a lot of difference, the best option so far is the self-curated Lists on Buttrfly but then I'm done with the browsing within 4-5 mins, I guess that's a good thing personally but not so much for the apps/protocol ‚ò∫Ô∏è

These tokens do not hold any monetary value and can't be sold anywhere, however, you might be able to collect some utilities (or future drops) with these in the coming future, so HODL them tight (not that I leave you with a choice) üôèüèΩ

Alright speaking of incentives, lets do an experiment. 
Since this is the first week of #LensMove , On the coming Sunday - I'll be airdropping 10000 $POINTLESS (max per day) to participants who check in with a Proof-Of-Move picture on Lens (and hopefully at least 30 mins of workout), make sure to add the hashtag #LensMove so I can discover you. 
Those who already qualified at least once ü™Ç:
@lens/punkess x 2 
@lens/iamtherealyakuza 
@lens/melikebarut 
This would be the first iteration of the challenge; We will make the future terms and conditions on the go based on this week's outcome or until I run out of tokens üòÇ

Good luck and keep moving üí™üèΩ 
PS: If you'd like to fund this challenge, consider collecting this post with $pointless

Content: This was one thing that attracted me towards Lens in the beginning. 
Lenster for Feed.
LensTube for Videos
Orb/Buttrfly for Media + Feed

However, now Im inclined towards what you said, Lens needs to dissolve in the background for the apps to thrive. 

Buttrfly is building is own Zora/Sound on top of the Lens layer , thats a general direction that every app could cater to a particular niche audience, functionally as well as culturally.

Content: With all due respect ser, I think this photograph's rights wouldn't even be with Daft Punk, its either the one who shot (if he was independent) or the BBC's.

Of course, it isn't about the money in this case, but about the principle of 'owning on-chain assests'

This is exactly the thing non web3/NFT people attack us about - "why pay 1 ETH for a digital art piece when I can copy pasta it to my PC"
Nothing wrong with it, but then it doesn't leave much argument for an on-chain photograph to be 'sold' in the first place, you know what I mean?

Content: imo out or many reasons, Klima failed because it was too early to rise and to be dumped, the chart looked too crazy to be taken seriously by the outsiders (even by crypto standards) + there were questions about the legitimacy of the tokenized Carbon credits and if they represented the value they claimed it to be. 

Another point - in Olympus' case one could see a treasury rise as a result of (3,3) with ETH, DAI etc whereas for Klima the treasury compromised of Burned Carbon Credits, which as noble as it sounds cannot be redeemed anywhere 'cause by its nature, it's RWA was already burned.

Now, some people treat this like it's a crime against nature, as if slapping a little tropical vibe on a disc of cheese and dough will cause the universe to implode. You'd think someone pitched them an idea of ketchup as a suitable coffee creamer, the way they react!

Listen, pineapple on pizza is like that unexpected guest at the party who somehow becomes the life of the party. Sure, it wasn't on the original guest list, but once it shows up, it brings the fun. It's the mix of the sweet and tangy tropical flair cutting through the pizza's cheesy, salty, and saucy business. Pizza with pineapple is like a beach vacation in your mouth. Some say it's not traditional, I say tradition schmadition, give your pizza a bit of that funky island beat! üççüçïü§åüèΩ

Content: ChatGPT - "Br√ºckentag" is a German word that roughly translates to "bridge day" in English. This term is commonly used in Germany to describe a day that falls between a public holiday and a weekend.

For example, if a public holiday falls on a Thursday, the Friday immediately following it could be taken off as a "Br√ºckentag," creating an extended four-day weekend. Many people take advantage of this by taking a vacation day on this "bridge day" to enjoy a long weekend.

Content: Respectfully ser, I disagree üôèüèΩ 
I think the one of the major mind fucks of the society has been to romanticize "the process" forever, and ever. 
It's this "Trust the process, perfect the process" that leads to the notion of having Patience. Because if one doesn't reach the goal given the time constraints of human life span, there's always an excuse that 'look I worked so hard on the process, alas I tried' 

When one truly wants something, care for something- Yes, the process exists as an intermediary, and for an outsider it may seem that they are following a process, but for them, its life and death. They are not "patient" on the process. They want, and will get it done no matter what. And hence, the initial post.

Content: While what you said is true and I think most people in Germany get that- however, the main argument from the opposition is the potential level of destruction it could bring in case of a nuclear fallout - Chernobyl and Fukushima incidents played a major role. Many don't want such a plant running in their vicinity and understandably so. Classic Risk vs Reward. 

Also what @amspecialist.lens mentioned, waste management isn't that optimal - because mining new uranium is currently cheaper than building and running facilities that could recycle them. 

Might I add that technically it is possible to recycle nuclear waste several times, which as a result also reduces the amount of years it stays radioactive -> from 700-1000 years down to 100-200 years.

Content: Very interesting - About 5-6 months ago I remember writing a comment somewhere that in reality, my engagement is solely with 11-12 lens users. Perhaps, the number has slightly increased to 15-16 now. 

From my perspective, I guess it depends on how one defines attention/relevance? 
The Attention/Staying relevant economy is imho - draining, for the creator and perhaps in some ways for the audience as well. 

So what works (long term/forever) is keep doing your thing until you find YOUR audience.  Any other kind of attention/relevance is short lived - which, btw is totally fine and nothing wrong with it, if that's the goal of the creator/audience.

Content: GM ser. Thanks for sharing your thoughts;  I'll qualify my post further: 
The things I absolutely couldn't live without, I either already have them or I know for sure, without an iota of doubt, that I WILL get there. By 'things' I mean a state of life, state of mind, or arriving at truth. 

Whereas, for things that I need 'motivation' for, a '7-step plan' or the 'need to enjoy the journey' are things I don't really want in the deepest corners of my heart, but instead these are conditioned pursuits which I picked up from the society as being the 'right/proper way'.  

Also, the only reason I set a destination is so that I could GET there. Like I posted, I tried enjoying the journey for the longest time and its not a state I could live in, especially when I got limited time here. 

All of this is highly personal, hence I stress on the word 'I' as its probably not the way everyone thinks. I'm sure your POV is also personal and hence, works for you üòÑ Much love üíö

Content: I think it's true at some level, although I obviously cannot back it up with 'decades of study', hence, it's also just a conjecture - but based on some IRL events. 
For instance, If I had free will, I would never choose to suffer, but unfortunately, I do suffer. And most of it is through the mind. And given that I'm writing this comment, fully aware of why I suffer, I have no influence on whether I will or will not suffer in the future; Which begs the question - am I really free?

Content: Makes total sense - so the 'textual' data gets stored as metadata directly on L3, for which the gas fee is currently being paid by Lens/Aave.
But there must be costs to using Arweave for storing all the media content, which I assume would be higher than the L3 gas. IPFS is free, but afaik all Lens Collects media get stored on Arweave.

For the things I deeply care about, I naturally have no choice but to get them.. there no pressure, but a natural obsession. 
And I agree with you that destinations change ‚ú®

This would also explain why Germany or the EU, in general, is not the breeding ground for more innovative/riskier projects when compared to the US and other emerging areas for the past 20 years; just my assumptions and likely that I could be wrong here. 
I have seen the startup culture on the rise lately, at least in the bigger cities but like everything, it has its pros and cons üòÉ

Content: Thanks Carsten, I understand where you're coming from- I'm not saying that people who "free collect" have some underlying expectation for a reward (if they do, then you're right, perhaps the content was being collected by the wrong people). 
Here I'm curious about how 'Free Collect' could be used as a more useful tool from a creator perspective. So far I've seen the reasoning to collect as a substitute for "Really liking something beyond just pressing the like button" and for "Saving it". 
@cavernaeremita.lens suggested some interesting insights on how free collects could be used to build communities upon communities, which I think could be a great use case: https://lenster.xyz/posts/0x1d6e-0x082f-DA-c7641050

There are a few apps around the collect database popping up like @collectz.lens , however, the showcasing part needs to be somehow embedded in the apps where most users hang out on. @orbapp.lens  'top supporters' feature is a step in that direction. Perhaps down the line, it would be cool to choose to highlight a few collects on the profile on a weekly basis?  Could be named  "Creators that I support" üòÑ

Content: imo the longer a wallet has stayed "hot", the less secure it is - and thus moving it to a cold one would defeat the purpose. I'd make a fresh wallet on the cold storage and transfer the most valuable stuff to it (its a pain, I know) . 

For future minting, I'd buy everything "valuable" directly via the cold wallet. 
For semi-casual mints I'd keep them on the hot wallet.

Planning to do this myself üòÑ

Content: I've tried all kinds of variations and, 1) as a creator - I feel more connected to the person collecting my 1/1s. So much so that I associate that piece with the person collecting it. That piece becomes solely theirs, just like IRL. 

2) As a collector, I feel more inclined to collect something which is 1/1 for the same reason; imo it also goes beyond the "supporting the artist" aspect (which btw is a great cause in itself)

8 > 1 > 9 > 6 > 10  > 5  > 7 > 4 > 3 > 2 

One additional point from my side could be the seamless sharing across all lens apps, something like @lensvert.lens but more integrated with the share option in every Lens app.

Content: Gm - Do you feel inclined to collect 'free collects' on Lens? why/why not? 

I want to make use of free collects as a database for future drops/utilities/raffles, but at the moment it's mostly the bot-like accounts collecting them. ü§ñ

imo, free-collects only truly make sense when there is a clear benefit associated with them, which should be explained in the same post offering it. For example, if a post states that the first 10 collectors will be eligible for an upcoming raffle, it provides a tangible incentive for collecting it. Without such incentives, I haven't come across many reasons to actively pursue collecting them. ü§î

If not for botting, this would also be true for free collects, but imo could be mitigated by limiting the number of collects.

The notion of 'supporting creators' is noble but not sustainable - same way it applies to an app. Since we're talking about making a living and not sporadic side income, imho there must be clear value generated for the audience or the platform. Be it by exclusivity, education, association or 'brand power' and reliability a creator has to offer - so a net positive for the creator/platform/audience/collectors.

As is the case with everything, there are and will be exceptions and outliers. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this :)

Content: I'd say the latter. ngl I still don't know what to make of it, editing photos also makes it somewhat artificial, right? 
this is just another layer to it. 

imo photography could be seen in two ways:
- Documenting: where realism and not messing around the original is of utmost importance. 
- Expressive: where nothing really matters till the time one is able to express themselves.

Content: very interesting responses here. imho it's not art, the same could be said for many 'mechanical' things even humans create. 

Probably sounds a lil voodoo but I'll take my chances - Art is not created, Art 'happens' as a by-product of a human being getting dissolved in the act, so much so that they end up creating something even they don't understand. For when the art happened, they weren't there "creating" it, but instead witnessing it as it unfolded through them. 
And that's why I think its solely a human phenomenon which I'm not sure an AI could replicate on its own. 

That being said, one could def use AI, just like a brush, but they would be severely limiting themselves as the brush now as a mind of its own.

Content: Freedom to create comes before any kind of creation. Art shouldn't have an obligation to please anyone, Art shouldn't fit anywhere; if it does try to fit in, it stops being art and more of commercial entertainment which we have seen already in the web2 playbook. 
Lens has all the ingredients and has become the wild wild west of the internet. Its just a matter of time before people realise this ‚úä

imo, although lives are way more easier now, but the happiness/'freedom from anxiety quotient' (if there's a term like that), is still more or less the same, if not worse.

Learned something new today from your write-up (will check out the video).  I'm wondering what could be the use of probabilistic computing -  perhaps for abstract topics where we don't have objective results? And I wonder if it could become a point of failure (from a human POV) of trying to make AI "more human". ü§î 

There were some interesting points about AGI made by David Deutsch in this convo with Naval (from 51:20) worth checking out imho https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWbcrObpUY&t=3701s

Content: That "stretched " look can be achieved with a wide angle lens, most of them distort the POV (pictures and footage from GoPros for example have this peculiar look). 
I guess, one is able to notice the difference when the original picture is available for comparison. Otherwise for a standalone picture, as you mentioned Photoshop added enough "depth" to make it feel real. 
Pretty insane that this is possible though, and fun to play around with. üòÑ

Content: aah dang üòÅ poetic if you think of it - I guess we can find meaning in everything if we look deep enough haha. I'll tell you mine: 
Monochrome, in its essence has 3 major colors (its not accurate, I know) - white, black, grey -> kind of like everything, one can choose to stay in either whites or blacks, but the reality doesn't work like that - it happens in shades of grey. We (society) create problems for ourselves by choosing the absolutes instead of living in that grey zone (middle lane), by which I don't mean living in confusion but rather open to possibilities. 

Also, sometimes colors can be distracting haha. Thanks for the supportüíö

It's interesting that grain is actually a product of inefficiencies in older film cameras, but its ingrained (üòâ) so much in our brains that it brings out a sense of depth, nostalgia and a sense of reality of viewing things on screen, that we still use it. As you said it sometimes makes things 'less plastic'. 
I wonder if the younger generation who will never see film photos would appreciate it the same way.

Creating a dispute-free, transparent on-chain gaming tournaments with a monetary/digital collectible prize would be made quite easy with this.

Content: totally with you - also that this is a very layered and nuanced topic.
Nobody wants to feel like just transactional entities, and words are the only medium one has in the virtual world that makes us connect to the other, become part of a story or an artist's/audience's journey. 

Furthermore, it becomes even more difficult if one is by nature an introvert. Like you pointed, I guess its about managing the extremes. 
Interactions for the sake of it, to the point it becomes disingenuous/unsustainable VS Not interacting at all.

- it would be great to also have the possibility to DM based on specific post collectors. 
- Automated DM's (using chainjet?) whenever someone collects a paid post.

Content: Very valid questions - must admit for the first time I grasped why content curation is equally important as creation. As a creator, I felt that good content would just organically stand out. But that's def not the case. Especially in Web3 where we don't want a policing 3rd party. 



Accurate segregation comes to mind for starters; for eg while posting a video - one must tag the video as accurately as possible: With a mandatory Title, description, Hashtags, and perhaps a small questionnaire about the Target Audience + Creators have to add whether content shared it a fact/opinion/entertainment etc. If its a fact then one must add the source along.  



Following this thread for more ideas.

Content: Good one! I like the idea of Patrons over followers. Or at least an attempt where Patrons are visible BEFORE one comes across the follower count. The creators/influencers and users would greatly benefit from Lens apps which give a better representation of supporters/patrons. 

In LensTube's case, as @chriscomrie.lens mentioned - we need more metrics, currently, IMO, 'likes' alone is not enough feedback, it needs reference metrics to make more sense of it, especially when there are so many bots.

you're right tho - I'm hoping to avoid some random comments/bots,  and aiming for targeted reach to people who would be interested in the type I content I create. My assumption here is that users with >4500 followers hold their curation signals more valuable than the 1 wMATIC they'll get from mirroring this ; They would have to WANT to share this, and I'd like to reward them for doing so.

He is actually looking to get on Lens for quite a while. @bradorbradley.lens @mirran.lens any way he could get in the garden? He's a data engineer and quite active in the web3 space.

Content: I don't think you can change your claimed lens handle. But you could have multiple handles tied to one wallet. 

So if you're eligible you could have a new Lens handle with a different name. 

I think its more of a feature than a bug :)

Content: IMO a very important discussion and glad you brought it up Jessy üôåüèΩ
Here's how I look at it, solely from the context of social media where one communicates using text and media:
1. My freedom of expression should not override anyone else's, no matter how different their views are from mine. 
2. My freedom of expression allows me to counter any views/opinions which I find wrong with my full might. There could be two results here, either, I convince the other party how ridiculous their points are, or I learn something new. 

*However, things don't usually go this way, it usually ends up with name-calling etc..* 
And therefore, 
3.  I reserve the right of stopping any communication with someone who retorts to petty word fights or slandering. 

The thing about 'Morals' and 'Ethics' is that over a course of time, they change, for eg -  there are plenty of people who spent their entire lives in prison because marijuana was, at a time considered immoral, and detested by society as a sinful thing. In those days, people thought they were 'protecting' society from smokers; *"How the turn tables"*  
there are many such examples. 

Also, a little off-topic but I feel it's necessary to mention here: The only censorship that is possible and rational is self-censorship or in small groups - Parents monitoring what their kids are on about is way easier and more effective than controlling an entire batch of students in a school. Any other kind of mass censorship leads to usually riots ( also, there is no decentralized way to do so imo). I know it's not the point of your post, but censoring things doesn't work over a long period of time, ever, and sets a bad precedent for solving problems through censorship instead of dialogue. 

To answer your question *":what if people start sharing sexist, antisemitist, racist and all sort of ‚Äúimmoral and unethical‚Äù ideas/contents?!"*
- I'd counter it, if it means so much to me I'll counter it with all my might using text (and memes, of course) while not name-calling /labeling them anything. At the same time, I'll be walking away if the other person starts talking shit or starts attacking, that's where I (and others who will read it) will know that this person is BSing. The same goes the other way around if I'm stupid enough to slander. 

We're lost the art of dialogue while being respectful. We started relying on a 3rd party as a proxy to solve it for us. Most Humans aren't full of evil, we just don't know them enough yet.

It's definitely centralized when compared to the likes of ETH (multi-sig of 5 or 6 people I think?), at the same time it's a great enabler and onboarding tool for a more decentralized internet.

Re #2 - There are a couple of workarounds:

1- I use the desktop app with a mobile wallet (Rainbow/Zerion) which keeps me logged in all the time.

2- Rabby Wallet changes the network based on the app open in the tab, so no need to switch every time.

Begs the question, if one is doing what they want, does it really matter of what they want to 'become'?
Because 'Doing' is real, 'becoming' is an abstract wish of 'what it may feel'

Time and again, I have seen in myself that I don't do well with processes. I end up becoming a slave to the process and want to perfect it, sometimes at the expense of the Goal. 

This brings it back to the level of devotion to the Goal - if I'm devoted to the Goal, I carve out a way one way or another; but if I'm not, I try and perfect the process because hey, I'm getting something done right?! üòÉ

Content: Curious to hear why it would be a bad thing? ü§î I know you're not saying that it is, but the fact you asked this question is implying the same.
- Is the person trying to solve a problem for someone using AI work? 
- Is the person transparent about how they produced the image? 
- Is the person simply exercising something they can do for fun and there are buyers? 

If the answer is yes + If the buyers exist, then demand is being fulfilled. I don't see anything bad about it, nor anything right, It just is. Why do we have to bring morality here? 

Is it bad for a realtor who didn't build the house themselves (and simply dialed a few numbers to connect people sitting on a couch), to sell it to someone for money? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Content: Grams, I've said it before and will say it again - you're exploring uncharted territory, even by Lens standards. Experiments like these help to pave a path not just for creators but also for the platform ü´°

I was hoping there would be some cohesion in the way token-gated stuff works across Lensport & Lenster. 

For eg, this could have been the ideal scenario (for now) -

- User collects #SHINJUKU42 pass. 

- Stumbles upon a token-gated #SHINJUKU42 piece on Lenster, which is token-gated. 

- Pass Holder- Clicks on decrypt, which decrypts the image because they are the pass holder. 

- Non-Holders - "Collect this post/Follow, or whatever condition to view content.   

A flavor of this can be done via Lensport, but tbh I use it solely as a marketplace-  For uploading pictures, viewing collectibles, Checking out offers, etc. The masses use Lenster the most, and we needed the most prominent app on Lens to have this capability to make it a seamless experience..



PS: was a good reminder to add the first 5 #SHINJUKU42 gems to my wallet; in the long run, these would be the first of their kind üòÉ

Content: I don't know if I related this hard to any piece of text in my life related to photography. 
I loved the analogy of the fleeting love for pop songs, its so true. Most of the pictures I ended up loving came from regular/irregular visits to my Lightroom library, even for the pictures which, I initially thought were unusable. Some took days, some have taken years. Long pauses between edits spanning days/months has made me more satisfied with the results but even more so with the process. 
Side-note : Let me add that you're as great at articulating things as you're a photographer and I'm glad you're here on Lens üíØ 

And of course, loved the picture üíö

Content: üíØ - I've had similar experiences, a lot of printed shots seem to be from old (vintage) times, however, a lot of modern photography seems to just stay digital (Demand and supply I guess) which is a shame because some of the shots these days would look amazing on a print. 

I do have a few printed shots, the last one being from @lufoart.lens (wen back on Lens? ‚òπÔ∏è ) and one can immediately feel the difference between a digital and a physical version.

Snapped this at a launch event at NFC Lisbon this year, where screens surrounding the event area pulsated with varying visuals synced to techno beats. I'll admit, techno's not really my vibe, but my camera was a handy distraction üòâ The lighting was very unpredictable but got lucky when this lady stepped up by the DJ, right before the screen in the background. Among a few attempts, this one stood out with the colorful patterns and her hand movement üòÑ

In these kinds of environments without external lighting, silhouettes work out quite well - posted another one from this event here if you're interested: https://lenster.xyz/posts/0x89dc-0x0fe2

Currently, It could be done with a "social contract" which is okay but imho, to giga send the creator economy on Lens this needs to be enabled at a smart contract level.

Content: Interesting points - 

- Trust comes with consistency and verifiability. Twitter accounts like zachxbt, Austismcapital, and many more have been doing it for free for the community. They are citizen journalists and get plenty of engagement without clickbait content and people who get value out of it pay them (transparent over blockchain)

Also, it's not clickbait if they actually talk/write about the topic, and if that's not the case people will eventually flock away. 

- It‚Äôs a question of attention - to which audience would you like to appeal? Make content FOR them. Personally, I would rigorously read/watch about things I'm interested in and glance over things that I'm not. 

- Agreed. And they cannot be verified as mostly there are no sources, just opinions. 

- Two points here 

	1. Do we really need to go through a training to document/journal the present? Historians try to capture what happened based on looking at murals and encrypted writing on a wall whereas we are preserving the present for the future by having these open dialogues and discussions which will always have an imprint over a blockchain. I'm not saying it‚Äôs the absolute truth, but capture enough (verifiable) discussions, and the future civilization will be able to understand their history. 

	2. Uploading web2 credentials to a wallet - I'm not well-informed here. Perhaps a centralized issuer for 'NFT of credibility'?

IMHO it's not about the credentials, you could be an anon, it's about the content you deliver - people don't have to trust, but verify you - which can be done on Web3.

Content: I think we're on the same page, but differ on the nuances. 
I would 100% choose to live in the current times because we have more convenience and a head start in not having to overcome the lack of basic human rights, wars,  lack of medical care, etc. This allows us to have more time to devote to things we are naturally inclined to do (although social media and societal rules play a negative role here, but that's a different discussion altogether).


The part on which I differ is that happiness wouldn't exist without sadness. If a certain level of convenience neutralizes sadness ( or anything we don't want to feel), then we wouldn't desire to be happy to begin with, and would live in a constant state of tranquility, which is obviously not the case.  
And yes, given the convenience, we def have a better chance to ponder over these things which earlier would not be even in the top 10 priority.

Content: *`"Would that be a bad thing to do?`I didn't do anything myself to make the images, and I'm trying to take peoples money for them I don't see any reason why I would deserve people's money for the images the AI made."*  
Wouldn't you say this brings this topic into the realm of morality? Look, I'm not saying you're the one passing judgment but the impetus of your post is asking if something's good or bad while implying it's bad because there's only one way anyone would perceive the word 'grifter' lol  

And yes, I understand what you mean -  In my comment above I'm also referring to the "default use case" - taking prompts off from Google and generating images, and that there's nothing good/bad about selling it. The buyer has an option NOT to buy it.
Sometimes people are lazy, and sometimes they don't want to do the work to find the perfect picture for their presentation, blog post or to hang on their bedroom wall, and rather just ask someone else to do it for them so they could focus on something else, which is fine, pure demand and supply in play üòâü§ù

If the 'Sticker' creator invested time and effort into creating something without intending to please or conform to any norms, then I'd call it art. It does not matter how others perceive it; they may appreciate it or overlook it. What matters is if the art had a genuine intention and meaning for the creator, then it has already fulfilled its purpose. 
Going beyond visual arts, the same could be said for a scientist, a leader, or anything which involves human creativity. And this is probably why 'true artists' and thinkers are often misunderstood at their time, for what they created, the society didn't relate to (or wasn't ready for)


When art is created with the intention of being consumed (although there is nothing wrong with this), it may lose its depth and meaning. And while it may still serve other purposes, it's questionable to me whether we can still consider it art. 
I could be completely off about this, but this is where I'm, at least for now.

From what I've seen so far, GMs, Nice, Good, Lol, etc are all going under 'show more comments'; nothing against the shorter comments, but this makes ordering and finding relevant stuff quick imo. 
Regarding comment ordering, I initially thought the older comments now show up on top, but looking at some posts this morning that doesn't seem to be the case ü§∑

 @andreih.lens does it make sense to exclude self-collects from this @lensport.lens chart?

Content: Its been around 24 hours; What I have liked so far: 
- The biggest one would be the ability to use lenster via an app (instead of a browser) on a phone
- The app is well thought off and doesn't feel like a "first iteration" from a UX standpoint.

The only thing I didn't like: 
- Cannot add Fee Collect to posts; it's a big bummer as I usually add my photos with fee collect embedded (I read this is because of Apple gatekeeping)

Content: Creating videos has been a difficult journey so far; one must convey a message by speaking + visuals. Similar yet very different to photography. 

Some thoughts on the process

‚Ä¢	**Scripting:** 70% of a good video depends on how well the script is crafted (including planning the A-rolls+B-rolls). The rest is just execution. Laziness is the key deterrent here, as I was not expecting video creation to be so write-intensive. 

`Catalyst needed- Discipline to sit down and write.` 

‚Ä¢	**Shooting:** The most challenging part (for me) as I didn't feel comfortable speaking naturally to a camera. However, it got better with practice. Remember to talk as if you're telling it to your friend. 

`Catalyst - Practice` 

‚Ä¢	**Editing:** This takes the most time, between 3-8 hours depending on the video. However, I don't mind as I enjoy this part the most. But time is a factor as, over time it becomes tiresome- The edit is no longer novel, and you grow tired of listening to yourself repeatedly. Therefore, to maximize enjoyment, one must organize ( B roll clips, sound design) to reduce the time.

`Catalyst - Digital Organization` 

‚Ä¢	**Thumbnails + Title:** No one clicks on the video if it‚Äôs not interesting enough - I plan a rough Title during scripting, but it changes throughout the process; Thumbnails needs a lot of practice, trial, and error. I want it to be fun, like editing photos, but that has not been the case so far. 

`Catalyst: Marketing + Visual Design.` 

Onwards..

It's amazing to see how deep one can drill down on each and every concept that one would come across during the learning process. So much so, I would prefer it over a book or an app.

Content: Good points. 

Profitable - for the individuals, yes; for corporations (specific to journalism), probably not so much

Incorruptible - Not 100% but way more than Web2. 

Regarding verifiability, we cannot verify hearsay, and that's not desirable anyway (unless it's for entertainment purposes); of course, look at Paul Graham's latest tweet saga. 

But that's not what I meant. I'm referring to verifying hard facts. Hard facts that affect day-to-day life. Hard facts are sometimes spun around with a flavor of mostly political opinions in Web 2.

That's what I cover in the video. The FTX saga had two different approaches: 

1. Opinion-based approach by NYT and other traditional news run by Academic Journalists. 

2. Hard Fact-based journalism by 'Autism Capital' and other anon individuals who used hard facts, which were verifiable on the blockchain. 

You're right about the Doctor's example because although the economy is going online, there will always be a need for physical-world activities. And verifiability via wallet doesn't apply to the physical world-based services (yet) - like doctors treating patients, sending people to space, etc. These need to be verified by a trusted party in person.

Content: tldr: kinda both.
In my late teens/early 20s, I exclusively wanted to go to a couple concerts. For the first one, I reluctantly gave up my ticket because a friend's crush wanted to join. He ended up marrying her, so I'm not too mad about it (now).
For the second one- the artist, sadly, passed away. 
At the moment, I haven't had much affinity for going to one but never say never.

The former is a wish (we try to find little tidbits of peace/happiness or whatever numbs our mind chatter), the latter is closer to the truth, in search of which can sometimes, IMO lead to such drastic action. 

That being said, it's just my naive opinion, as I have no idea what the state of mind of a person committing such an action would be. Also, I feel this topic could be discussed more in the open üôèüèΩ

As for grain, I'm neutral about it. I use it occasionally to add a dreamy touch and reduce the "ultra-sharp" feel of digital cameras. It really depends on the photo and the desired effect, I suppose. üòÑ 
How about you? I assume there are cool ways to add digital grain in Procreate. I've noticed a hint of it in the work you've posted on Lens.

Down the line, connecting the dots won't be relevant or required as we'll outsource this to the machines, one part of it would be building apps on the fly; @ryanfox.lens shared some readings on this  https://lenster.xyz/posts/0x016264-0x060b
Great art will become a realm mastered by few, a rare feat that no one has ever witnessed - which eventually gets distilled and distributed further by AI.

Content: Ser, I understand and mostly agree with your pov üôèüèΩ I'm also not trying to frame anything wrong or right. 
To add more context, I don't think art must be created FOR anyone, nor should it have the obligation to be viewed, appreciated, or deliver a message to anyone. Art has no purpose other than to be created by the creator, that's where it derives all its meaning. 
When one creates "art" FOR someone or FOR society to consume (which is fine btw, as there's no right or wrong or rules here) it becomes a commercial piece.

Content: Thank you for the explanation! I'm 100% with you on experimenting and love that you guys took the initiative. As I understood, the individual content of the NFT collection wouldn't play a role here and it's basically buying/collecting a stake within a creator's network. 

My mind immediately went to creators who create specific drops which are exclusive to the collectors. For example. @gotenks.lens and @memester.lens communities have specific posts, which if a user collects, grant them special perks. The same goes for photographers, like @grams.lens , I'm fine trading his regular Gm posts üòÉ but I wouldn't say the same for the photo drops that I have collected. 

I understand that the users have the right to chose not to trade, but overall, this model puts 'an exclusive post' and 'a regular post' under the same bracket. There's no distinction there.

I do believe that to sustain a decentralized social economy we'd need monetary incentives to function organically (including paid-content amplification). 'The balancing act' would probably take time, as over time people would establish the curators whom they can trust.

Content: Very interesting question; so far I have collected content because of this: 
- Entry pass to communities:
@memester.lens & @ghostgang100x.lens made me connect with so many interesting builders and creators on Lens 

- For the Art + Appreciate the creator beyond a Like and Mirror:
Some of the art has been super inspirational to look at/read,  Lens is full of amazing creators, and it's only going to increase. 

- Additional Perks/Surprises: 
Being the first one to collect @ghostgang100x.lens came with a nice surprise in my mailbox as a gift hamper üòÉ 
Collecting @ryanfox.lens #AREFLECTIVELENS photo series in December got me a Free Coffee Pass from his website which I already ordered, all in a web3 native way ‚òï 
Of course, I wasn't aware of this while collecting but this permissionless nature of rewarding anyone, for anything also makes collecting content exciting. Oh and btw, all of this is just unheard of anywhere else on the internet.

Content: oh my, your work is amazing!! also welcome to Lens, I'm convinced you're gonna have fun here üòâ  
I use quite a lot of apps on Lens, good thing is all my content/network stays with me no matter which app I use. Here's a quick overview (in no particular order)

Desktop
- Lenster : General Social media, catching up with what everyone's up to. 
- Pinsta: I use it as a photo portfolio to direct the audience to,  in a Lens native way: https://pinsta.xyz/chaoticmonk
- Lensport: Lens-native secondary marketplace for buying/trading collectibles. 
- Wav3s: Lens- native content advertisement platform. 

Mobile Apps 
- Lensta - directed more toward photo-specific content on Lens + the photo grid looks neat üòÉ
- Buttrfly/Orb - General mobile social media + great for content discovery. 

I left out a lot of nuances, but I think this would be a good starting point. 
Also, I'd recommend checking out the "Getting started with Lens" post by @punkess.lens https://lenster.xyz/posts/0x0f85-0x0edb

However, creating videos is a lot of fun and rewarding once you see an idea coming to life on the screen. At the same time, the process is relatively long and can get draining if I don't set a deadline for myself - I don't know if this is the case with you too? üòÇ

Content: Very interesting and I feel the same way about being able to think better in English. Although I don't think it's the effect of the language, perhaps more to the fact that most of the literature (at least which connects the world) tends to be in English. If one studied all the concepts of science, maths, art, and literature in a different language it could affect them differently, I've seen this in my parents' generation who didn't speak much English.

So, if one is using a generative tool-> they are the user of the database fed to that tool. 
The same goes for when one is using a database of RyanFox's pictures or Lens Posts to create a Chatbot/GenerativePhotos which creates specific content based on that -> They become a user of RyanFox üëç

In your experience, what has been the sweet spot for amplifying content? The goal is to have max eyes viewing and hopefully engaging with the content while avoiding bot mirrors/follows. 

- Higher reward for mirrors limited to higher follower count profiles. 

-Or low reward + lighter restrictions but more mirrors

- Ideas? 



The POAP and ERC-20 token filters are too nuanced that I don't think I'll use them for now + I don't have the data available to make an informed decision. I'd also be curious how people have been using commenting requirements. 

I've experimented with wav3s twice and got decent engagement but unfortunately most of it was with bots/people acting like bots. I'm not ruling out that the content could be subpar, but would be interested to hear what has been working well for users without the post giving a "spammy" feel.


That being said, I'm net bullish on wav3s and happy that Lens has a web3-native content amplification method baked into it. ü§ùüåä

We need more tinkering around to dial it in.

Love it. And the more the apps create the tools (first) and earlier & easier it is for a creator to find one which fits their content better. Plus, anybody can build over the Lens stack so it's not a matter of if, but wen! üëÄ

Content: Can someone help me grasp the concept behind the Creator Token on¬†@youfolio.lens  /¬†@lensport.lens ¬†From what I've gathered:

1. Only the first person to collect a creator's post matters.

2. A Creator's 'Token collection' consists solely of their initial collectors.
I'm puzzled as to why only the first post holds significance ü§î. What about collectors who acquire numerous posts from a creator, even if they aren't the first?
Maybe splitting the creator token by free/paid collects could better differentiate between 'real support' and 'being an early collector'.

Q: What kind of photos do you take from your Smartphone or any camera 90% of the time? If at all. 
Please comment 1 OR 2 based on the category you fall in (feel free to add comments) 
**1 -** From a Photography Point of View -> Landscape, Portraits, Street, Astro etc.
If you ever intentionally composed a shot to look aesthetic in your pov, you can select this category üôÇ
**2-** Everything else - To capture moments with family and friends or selfies + photos of documents/seedphrases etc üëÄ¬†

Based on the results, I will have some üì∏ alpha dropping soon!

Content: It's been a long time coming;¬†#genesispost¬†from yours truly,¬†



`Who am I?`

I'm not a Monk, but I am sometimes Chaotic.¬†

My IRL name is irrelevant, but in case one feels hell-bent on finding, it's not that difficult. I'm 29 years old, brought up in Punjab (India), and have been living in Germany for the past 6 years. I enjoy playing and watching football (the one played with feet) and am always curious about tech and the web3 world.



`What I do?`

I'm a self-taught photographer and started my journey shooting on a phone about a decade ago. I don't have a niche and don't deliberately try to find one. I shoot whatever catches my eye and during the edit, I try to map my state of mind onto it. I have a running photo series named¬†#FotoADay, where I post one collectible 'Foto' every day. It's currently on Day #112. These pictures are available exclusively on Lens, and Lens only.¬†

You'd find me occasionally tinkering with videos on LensTube.¬†

Apart from this, I also work full-time at a SaaS company in Germany.¬†



`What's my Philosophy?`

There are instances when I'm mindful, and then there are instances when I'm mindless - I try to do more of things that take me to the latter, the elusive "flow state".



`What's next?`¬†

- Changes to the Foto Series format, I'll share more on this in the coming weeks.¬†

- More Video Content -> Next video is named 'Experience India in 2 mins' dropping soon on LensTube as the continuation of 'Experience Iceland in 2 mins'¬†https://lenstube.xyz/watch/0x89dc-0x01bc

-In these early days of Lens, there are a few legends who showed support to an anonymous photographer named 'Chaotic Monk', and I want to highlight that all that support doesn't go unnoticed. I have something cooking especially for them üíö



I look at the Lens ecosystem as a grand social experiment, an experiment that gives the power back to the participants with full ownership of their words and content and I couldn't be more excited to be a part of it.¬†

Content: The recent Lens game by @punkess.lens made me think how language is such a basic thing all of us pick up while growing up, so much to the point where we are intuitively able to 'think in a language' ;

But, I don't remember having so many thoughts (unwanted ones too) when I was a kid, and it makes me wonder, how much of a role a language plays in facilitating thoughts, even more so on whether it restricts its free flow.
Would I be able to 'think' more or differently in a different language?

 imo Club football is more like a fantasy, where you can bring to life certain scenarios which aren't possible at the national level - "what if this player played with this" which makes it fun, but perhaps one (players included) doesn't feel as invested into them as much as national games.

Content: What has worked for me is the hands on experience, which was quite expensive on ETH but these days there are a lot of options. 
For eg,
1. Ramp $$ directly on Argent Wallet on zkSync. 
2. Connect it to zigzag- Trade some token. 
3. Bridge to other layer 2s, buy some NFTs. 

Same could be done with Polygon but the Metamask learning curve could take longer. 

Argent have a lot of resources to newbies to get started with self custody.

*Not shilling them, just been an active user and have onboarded a few from my network via Argent.

Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Youtube... - Your work, your identity could be taken away from you by one click of a button. 

Lens- No one can un-person you even if they want to. ‚úäüèΩ

Content: Watched it twice as I couldn't understand 20% of the dialogue in an IMAX screening due to the music overpowering it at times, for a dialogue dense movie, I missed a lot of subtext. Add to the fact that I was sitting in the 3rd row from the screen which I thought would be ok but made no sense at all. imo they should just stop making these seats in a 4:3 display, my neck was hurting and the characters looked distorted (i'll post a reference in the next comment). Thats it for my rant. üôèüèΩ My initial rating was 5/10 

The second time, albeit on a regular screen was way better - imo the movie captured the essence of what it might have been in that time quite well. Nuclear Energy has always been a fascinating subject ever since I heard of it during achool days. Acting was 10/10 from everyone. The convoluted story line at times felt unnecessary but it did make a rather linear story more interesting. As @mazemari.lens mentioned, the soundtrack by Ludwig G√∂ransson was top notch üíöüé∂
Now, I'd rate it an easy 9/10 üçø

Content: hahah nice one - I guess I'm at the transition to 'abandon' mostly because of how the club is diverging away from the philosophies that made me like them in the first place. 
Iniesta was and still is the most effortless player I've seen on the pitch ü•πüíö
Nice to hear you've been following along Barca's journey - And I would agree its been all downhill for Barca and football as a whole since Neymar came in (although I did enjoy the MSN era). 
The insane amount of money flowing into football after Neymar's 222million Eur release to PSG is just making it more commercial and plastic at the higher level.
