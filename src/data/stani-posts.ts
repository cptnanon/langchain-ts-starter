      "Yesterday, I underwent surgery to remove one of my organs. I want to share my story about what happened, hoping it might be helpful for everyone, especially for founders and builders who are tirelessly working on their startups, to appreciate their health.\n\nI‚Äôve been working tirelessly since 2017 on Aave and later Lens and Avara. My normal working hours have been a minimum of 12 hours and often more for years. I‚Äôve taken holidays here and there without fully disconnecting from work. I didn‚Äôt mind because I love what I‚Äôve been building, and my focus has been on creating a more accessible, fair web that benefits all.\n\nThat being said, I rarely thought about my health, especially with all the travel and moving countries in between. During the early days of Aave (then known as ETHLend), I moved from Finland to be closer to our new office in Switzerland. My diet changed completely with the move. I remember one particular day at the office, after a heavy lunch, finishing some work that evening with Emilio (current VP Engineering at Aave Labs) on Aave V1. We were about to leave to see his band, where he was the drummer, play a gig.\n\nWhile helping to move the drums, I started to feel radiating pain in my back, which I thought was muscle pain or from sitting too much. The pain got so bad that I could not stay put that night. It was gone the next day, and I thought it was over.\n\nI didn‚Äôt go to the doctor as I had a full schedule that week and some upcoming events the week after. We were grinding and talking to every user we knew to understand better how we could build a better product, and everything else for me was secondary. We launched Aave V1, and over time it became a success as we kept working hard.\n\nLater in 2019, I decided to move to London as we found it an appealing location for the team. I kept getting the back pain regularly, and it was so strong that OTC pain meds didn‚Äôt help at all. One time, I had to call an ambulance in the middle of the night, which took me to E\u0026A. Nothing was diagnosed at that time, and the GP recommended seeing a specialist for an MRI scan. I stupidly neglected it, explaining to myself how busy I was. It feels to me that crypto works around the clock, and since messaging moved more to instant messaging combined with all the time zones, it easily feels like work never ends. There is constant pressure for everyone in the space, whether chasing liquidity, users, PMF, or something else.\n\nOver time, these attacks increased, and I tried to ‚Äúdeal‚Äù with the condition myself until my partner, Paris, demanded I seek care. I went for an MRI and discovered there was a large enough gallstone in the gallbladder that could not pass or could get stuck after passing from the gallbladder. Knowing this, I now had relief about narrowing down what my problem was, and the cure was either completely changing my diet or surgery. I neglected the idea of surgery as it would take time, and I felt too occupied. I tried to deal with it myself again. I stopped drinking alcohol completely, had my last beer last year, and even stopped coffee, switching to tea.\n\nAll these dietary changes helped for a while, but things got worse. I started to have more frequent attacks with significant pain in the back and abdomen, leading to frequent trips to E\u0026A and doctors. The final straw was this Monday when I had the biggest attack and almost fainted. We scheduled surgery for the same week in London with a good doctor under anesthesia using keyhole surgery.\n\nI was lucky to have the surgery done as we discovered that my gallbladder was completely wrecked. It was infected, inflamed, and pouring blood, potentially even risking pancreatitis if the stone had blocked the duct passage.\n\nI was discharged the same day and am now resting to get back in shape for next week to be at full capacity. It annoys me how naive my approach to my health was. My problem wasn‚Äôt necessarily the hours I put into the business over the years but the lack of hours I dedicated to my personal health, especially given how smoothly the surgery and whole process went. I also don‚Äôt believe anymore after my experience that founders and builders can achieve the best outcomes if they are not fully healthy.\n\nI hope this can be a reminder to everyone that success is measured in the longevity of constant output, and to have longevity, you need health. There is no other way around.\n\nI want to thank everyone, especially my partner @lens/paris, who has been supportive during this long and eventful week in my life. ‚ù§Ô∏èü©π",

Mainly because that information is usually "read once" and does not provide additional utility to keep it while scrolling the profile feed\n\n\\- Commenting on a post didn\u0027t work for me for some reason\n\n\\- Composer design still something that I am digesting...\n\n\\- The top navigation above the composer has infinite scroll so hard to figure\n\n\\- Toasters could have more nicer design\n\n\\- Some improvements needed on the loading time\n\nOverall I think Pingpad has a lot of potential and can\u0027t wait to see the next iteration. üíö',

If a blockchain\u0027s culture does not value curiosity and openness to new technology, then it may well fail at both decentralization and speed, because it fails to take up new technologies like ZK-SNARKs that can get you more of both at the same time.*"\n\nAs blockspace is becoming more affordable with L2s and especially with Validium combined with UX tools like Paymasters, Smart Wallets and Embedded Wallets, its very easy to state that the mainstream users don\u0027t care about the underlying tech, they just want x.\n\nWhile its true that products need to be simple, great and accessible, we should not forget that the underlying culture should always care whats important. To me thats decentralization, open graph and open source technology. We should steer away from shortcuts or hacks on the interface level that fully diminishes these fundamentals that sets the culture.\n\nBuild for the users, for the culture.',

This also means that politized judgements or interpretations of the law can become a reason to take down opinionated accounts.\n\n\n\nThere are lot of cases in history where the law or court judgements have been used as a political tool.\n\n\n\nA way to enable open and fair social spaces would be by relying on a network that can ensure data integrity for social data (accounts, followers, content). If a node does not respect the data integrity, it gets disqualified and removed. New nodes will appear due to the cryptoeconomic incentives.\n\n\n\nThats why I am also bearish on existing federated data models since there are little incentives to establish data integrity. Nodes can be paid to run these servers to serve data and ‚Äúto be nice‚Äù but without a consensus, there is no guarantee for data integrity.\n\n\n\nOnce there is a consensus over data integrity, social primitives can be established and ownership rights issued to private/public key holders of the network participants. Virtually Bitcoin relies on the same mechanism for establishing ownership guarantees over a financial primitive.\n\n\n\nThis is why I am bullish on using onchain for providing security to ensure data integrity and ownership that eventually can enable censorship resistance. Moderation would still work on an application/platform level without seizing users accounts and voice on protocol level.\n\n\n\nIt‚Äôs a fundamental transition from don‚Äôt be evil to can‚Äôt be evil.",

I am also thinking that as long as users are on a shared network, there is less of a cold start problem and instead its a graph choice. Also nothing should stop for tapping to the global graph or making content globally, but the design of DeSoc protocol should reflect natural behaviours. People enter to different spaces to experience something different (or familiar).",

As usual, the protocol allows anyone to post content and interact with other users. Lens API is used to enable enhanced experience across Lens apps thats using Lens.\n\nHere is the list (if you want to help, feel free to drop your name below in the comments)\n\nlens/pedrovilela\nlens/nilesh\nlens/kipto\nlens/zkjew\nlens/arterlioz\nlens/augustuscaesar\nlens/jamesfinnerty\nlens/1_cryptoman\nlens/definn\nlens/albiverse\nlens/punkess\nlens/lens\nlens/aave\nlens/stani\nlens/wagmi\nlens/yoginth\nlens/bradorbradley\nlens/christina\nlens/pablo\nlens/essah\nlens/sasicodes\nlens/jouni\nlens/paris\nlens/nicolo\nlens/helpfulbrother\nlens/cantech\nlens/pawel\nlens/cesare\nlens/cree\n\nThese profiles operate with 3 strike system. Report once \u003d 1 week rate limit, report twice \u003d 3 week rate limit, report three times \u003d indefinite rate limit on the API. Kind reminder that rate limit will only reduce reach through Lens API (used by many of the Lens apps) and apps that have their own backend that would reflect the gardener actions. Developers have the opt-in option to use it or not. Reported users data is still retrievable from the protocol level and these users (most likely bots) would be still able to interact with the protocol but friendly apps won\u0027t give them reach.\n\nThere is no data available for who reported a profile for obvious reasons, however flags can be disputed (dispute system can be created via LIP for example).\n\nThis system is a quick win for permissionless and can be improved and governed via LIP as we the community can assess how the system works. Adding and removing names could also be governed via LIP in the future (i.e. removing Lens team members etc). Hopefully gardeners will make Lens a better place upon going permissionless.\n\nFeel free to leave your thoughts below.",

What if creators pay for algos and "earn" distribution and new audiences, which brings them more monetization. The key difference here compared to web2 is that, even if you would pay for good discovery, you are not owning what you will receive, everything is indirect (followers and monetization, all tied to the platform).

      "Thanks for the feedback. The current approach does work on a small network, however would be hard to scale unless there is some sort of a scaled way to verify qualified users for zero gas and costs.\n\nThe spam fee is interesting. Maybe it could work in a way where if someone comments on users posts they will leave a small stake and the post creator has the option to claim the stake within 24 hours. If its spam, the post creator would claim it. If the post creator would do a dishonest claim, other users would not leave comments onto that users posts. There could be claim history available which would help to see what kind of posts the user has claimed a stake.\n\nWhat I like about the staking is that its optimistic, no fee is needed until there is actual spam and secondly, it bothers the post creator. Also, commenters would be more thoughtful before they would comment given there is a risk of loosing a stake.",

      "I‚Äôve been encountering forks for a while now and have few findings that everyone might find useful. First of all, forks are important for the open source culture and replication of the software. Forking code for learning purposes or even commercial purposes fuels innovation. Usually there is no point of reinventing the wheel while some modifications or improvements might be helpful on a fork. Fork can also be a community-driven decision on vision. Maybe there are two paths to improve the codebase and enabling both visions requires forking (Linux distributions for example).\n\nIn web3 forking has been a method to fuel new communities (and some cases just to enforce meaningless token farming). Forked code has helped to distribute software across different EVM networks and I would argue that having a copy of Uniswap on every network make sense especially on networks where transactions fees are lower as it helps to onboard more users from centralized finance, faster that the core team could deploy, adding net positive value.\n\nHowever, some of the protocols onchain might be technically and economically complex systems. This means that forking these protocols would require the engineers to understand these systems inside out, otherwise there might be potential issues or open attack vectors. Most of the exploits over the past years in DeFi has been the cause of the developers mainly not knowing the code while implementing minir changes and thats a fundamental problem with complex DeFi protocols (lending, complex amms etc).\n\nWhen you are using a complex fork be mindful that the developer team on the fork doesn‚Äôt necessarily have sufficient understanding of the codebase even if its a identical fork, in case of issues there might be less understanding for remedy and how to fix things. When you are using a fork, you are taking excess risk. Which can be okay if you agree on taking it.",

      "Web3 today centers around expressing transferable, financialized assets, rather than encoding social relationships of trust. Yet many core economic activities‚Äîsuch as uncollateralized lending and building personal brands‚Äîare built on persistent, non-transferable relationships. In this paper, we illustrate how non-transferable ‚Äúsoulbound‚Äù tokens (SBTs) representing the commitments, credentials, and affiliations of ‚ÄúSouls‚Äù can encode the trust networks of the real economy to establish provenance and reputation. More importantly, SBTs enable other applications of increasing ambition, such as community wallet recovery, sybil-resistant governance, mechanisms for decentralization, and novel markets with decomposable, shared rights. We call this richer, pluralistic ecosystem ‚ÄúDecentralized Society‚Äù (DeSoc)‚Äîa co-determined sociality, where Souls and communities come together bottom-up, as emergent properties of each other to co-create plural network goods and intelligences, at a range of scales. Key to this sociality is decomposable property rights and enhanced governance mechanisms‚Äîsuch as quadratic funding discounted by correlation scores‚Äîthat reward trust and cooperation while protecting networks from capture, extraction, and domination. With such augmented sociality, web3 can eschew today‚Äôs hyper-financialization in favor of a more transformative, pluralist future of increasing returns across social distance.\n\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id\u003d4105763",

      "Careful everyone with phising scams out there! ‚ö†Ô∏è\n\nThere has been few incidents recently where community members lost their profiles due to a phishing scam on Twitter and its heartbreaking to see folks losing their profile even if they can rebuild the audience, its not the experience we are looking for even on a protocol level. üòû\n\nWe build the Lens Protocol to be agnostic to various social networking use-cases and also realized that being able to secure your profile is extremely important for the users. While we have seen some iterations of tools to secure profiles, we introduced a way to add additional security (and make it normie proof) measures for Lens V2 that would mitigate similar attempts.\n\nSince Lens has grown so much in the past year and has an active community, we feel that we need to take action sooner and deploy a solution that helps to secure the profiles on similar scams. Therefore, we are going to release an update that improves significantly the security of the profiles before Lens V2. This is our priority now. ‚ö°Ô∏è\n\nThank you for helping out to point the issues and if anyone has experienced a phising attack or seen one, please DM across Lens.\n\nRest stay tuned for the update üåø\n\n",

Mastodon is even more challenging since if someone hosts a server and decides to take it down, there is going to be loss of content.\n\nWe already see issue with the scaling with Bluesky as they are trying to scale the whole system to every users. The most effective way to have real decentralized social is by using blockchain for identities/profiles and even audiences and Data Availability layers for content (similarly what Momoka is doing).\n\nThe scaling issue comes with the syncronization with all these servers or hubs (whatever you call them). With Momoka, all data goes to a one shared db. I think @ryanfox.lens had somewhere a good take on this as well.\n\nI personally would see Fediverse suitable for some kind of third party discord hosting than anything else for now in terms of use-cases.\n\nBut underlying technology might change for apps, I did see Twitter dumping Ruby on Rails as it didn\u0027t scale for them either, while Twitter was the flagship for RoR.",

      "My first hour into Joe Rogan - Mark Zuckerberg podcast and here are some thoughts\n\nZuck envisions that social becomes more immersive, pretty much the bet Meta has been going after since the rebranding. I definitely agree that there will be lot of space for new social networking in surfaces we all are still exploring (VR, AR etc) and big part of the experience would be immersive. There is lot of value to experience social in 3D and making this experience as real as possible, even if its not the same experience as IRL. According to Zuck the focus now is to make incremental improvements on the experience itself - things like having your avatar reflect your facial expressions is valuable.\n\nAlso Zuck mention an interesting topic on.... Holographs! Recent progress on holograms is getting better - seeing earlier 2pac as hologram and now the latest excitement on Abba Voyager hologram tour, I am quite bullish on what could be done as the tech matures more.\n\nImmersive social will never be the exact same as you would feel when you would meet someone IRL, but it would definitely create a new layer of social experiences we all can benefit from.\n\nWhether to choose a headset, glasses or 3D holographic experience appearing in front of me, for me its the holograms",

      "Yesterday Lens Protocol announced the CultivatorDAO (üë©‚Äçüåæ,üë®‚Äçüåæ) to establish community driven content curation for Trust \u0026 Safety. Going to share our vision below on how we see the web3 social stack evolve üßµ\n\nFirst, Lens Protocol is a decentralized social media protocol that acts as a registry to point content and followers. Users can link to any content which can be stored on-chain \u0026 off-chain. Most of the content is off-chain (stored in IPFS or Arweave etc).\n\nThe Protocol is flexible enough to link the content even to a private cloud or to a self-hosted environment. This is an interesting use case for follower and token gated content. It\u0027s up to the applications and users to choose how they use Lens Protocol.\n\nLens Protocol design guarantees users the access to their own social network. You don\u0027t need to trust centralized or off-chain platforms with your followers. Meaning every user has their own social network.\n\nNot only you own your own network, but you also have the ability to broadcast content in a permissionless and censorship resistant way. Anyone you grant the access to your content has the ability to explore your creativity and self expression. This is decentralization by design.\n\nWhile decentralization is groundbreaking for web3 social, the amount of information and finding relevant peers and content for you to discover would be a time consuming mission. This reason is why we would see another stack evolve - the middleware - where curation lives.\n\nThe middleware layer already exists on Lens Protocol, there are tools such as Graph Protocol, RSS3, Sepana and the Lens API. The middleware layer consists from widely decentralized appoaches to being progressively decentralized depending on the use cases they serve.\n\nThe latest addition to the middleware are communities such as the CultivatorDAO, focusing on curation with Trust \u0026 Safety in mind. Where code cannot solve everything, we need communities to reflect their values and govern.\n\nThe DAOs of the Lensverse will serve the application layer for various tasks ranging from building discovery algorithms, content moderation and solving various challenges that social media faces today.\n\nThe key difference between the web2 and web3 social stack is that in web3, the stack is completely open. When you don\u0027t like a policy or an experience, as a user you should be able to find a new experience without leaving behind your accumulated social capital.\n\nHopefully we will see small communities evolve across the web3 social ecosystem, being utilized for tasks that would benefit from community governance.\n\nI would even imagine that every social media application built on top of Lens Protocol would have its own DAO consisting of its community members voted by the community that reflects the their own values.\n\nMost importantly, these DAOs can operate transparently and since the measures taken by these DAOs are public, there should not be any shadow banning (see here: https://lenster.xyz/posts/0x05-0x0417).\n\nBy ensuring human assessment and the design that leads to decentralization, we are able to ensure that web3 social doesn\u0027t become a closed platform and users are able to access to open social networks that are driven by community engagement \u0026 stewardship.\n\nBuilding a decentralized stack is a harder exercise than starting from a centralized approach, but brings the benefit of fully verified content linking on-chain wherever you store your content, ownership to your social graph, ability to use timestamps and create programmability.\n\nAnd most importantly: decentralized and on-chain content and follower registries opens up the programmability and composability to another level. Imagine pairing Lens with tools like Simo, Lit Protocol, DeFi, NFTs, ReFi and DAO governance.\n\nBesides reachitecturing the social stack, part of the mission for the Lens team is to make the social stack more accessible. Now with all interactions across the Lens Protocol, users do not need to sign or pay any gas. Blockchain on the backend, party on the frontend ü•≥\n\nNext Monday, you will be able to vote for CultivatorDAO with your Lens Profile to signal your support for community driven stewardship https://snapshot.org/#/cultivatordao.eth/proposal/0xd512345eb6c9b7bbf57b28a8b4f7dc46d31ab6c19ac8ad5de4605fa52fcb9e98\n\nIf you love our vision and what we are building, collect and mirror this post to retain your early user flexing rights üåø",

      "Some thoughts how Lens ecosystem could evolve. First there should be a baseline out of the box features and algos available to all apps/use-cases to rely upon. This helps to mitigate cold start issue for all the new experiences and apps. Second, the apps could build their own algorithms and curate their audiences. The most exciting experience would be when you can login with Lens to all the appa but each app curates experiences and content based on their community and audience meaning that you get completely different experience on Orb, Buttrfly, Phaver etc even when everyone is using the same shared network. This direction would bring some diversity for the apps and builds awesome communities. Especially when Lens becoming fully accessible, the bebefits would be amplified üåø",

      "Now that the @AaveAave Community is preparing for Aave Protocol V3 deployment for Ethereum market üëª its good time to review why V3 as a flexible architecture is much appreciated üëáüèº\n\nThe @AaveAave V3 was deployed earlier this year across various networks including Polygon, Avalanche and L2s such as Arbitrum and Optimism as a cross-chain strategy.\u2028\u2028For context, Aave V1 was launched on main-net back in January 8, 2020 right before the DeFi summer and accelerated to null Billion TVL within 6 months. Bringing also flashloans adoption into DeFi. ‚ö°Ô∏è\n\nAave V2 was new innovation based on predecessor V1 and was launched on December 3, 2020 (exactly 2 years ago) and peaked into $18.5 Billion TVL on October 2021 across multiple markets. üî•\n\nPost V2 launch, we realized that the stakes in DeFi grew from $0.5 to $180 Billion TVL over these years. This lead our team to focus on various risk mitigation models and similarly the capital efficiency became an important topic within DeFi.\n\nOur work at Aave lead to designing the Aave V3 - where the most exciting feature is actually the flexibility it brings for unlocking decentralized liquidity in both risk averse and capital efficient paths.\n\n\u2028\u2028Aave V3 introduced position state management where risk can be siloed by listing assets in Isolation Mode - meaning an asset can be listed with fixed debt ceiling set by the Aave governance and only borrowed against stablecoins, unlocking asset listings for less liquid assets without impacting the main assets. You can still supply other assets to earn but not to use as collateral.\n\nSimilarly V3 includes Siloed Borrowing, where an asset can only be listed as a single borrowable asset (without being able to borrow other assets). Extremely useful feature for low liquid assets with manipulatable oracles (i.e. borrowing Uni V3 pairs to hedge üëÄ).\n\nThe flexibility of Aave V3 architecture gives also the ability to enable markets where you can borrow stablecoins and have zero borrowing on your collateral in case you want to store the collateral within the protocol and not being borrowed out.\n\nOther risk management features included introducing Supply Caps and Borrow Caps per asset. Granular Borrowing Power Control also introduce the ability to lower borrowing power of any asset without impacting existing borrowers (better ux) while retaining the flexibility also to use the old V2 method as well.\n\nAave V3 also introduced the Risk Admins, which enables the governance to delegate permissions to react faster to changed market conditions i.e. between pre-set threshold or automation. Feature that could benefit widely the Risk Council https://governance.aave.com/t/improve-permissions-management-on-aave-v2-and-define-a-better-strategy-for-access-control-roles-on-aave-v3/10802/14\n\nVariable Liquidation Close Factor was also introduce to allow positions to be fully liquidated (vs. partial) which helps liquidators in their liquidation strategies.\u2028\u2028Part of Aave‚Äôs success story has been the openness from the Aave community to support to be a leader and the first mover for deployments across various networks where transaction fees are lower to bring more users into DeFi, the global, borderless finance.\n\nIn 2022, Mainnet V2 received around 150k unique deposits with an average deposit of $550k worth while Polygon V2 2.6 Million, average of $8.5k and Polygon V3 560k with and average of $2k deposit size! We realized that adoption requires the protocol to exist where users are on-boarding to use the blockchain with lower transaction fees.\n\nThis led us to focus also on various cross-chain features to empower liquidity movements between various Aave markets between different networks.\n\nOne specific feature is the Portal that allows governance to grant an ability (to fixed cap) to burn aTokens on source network (i.e. Ethereum and mint them on the destination network (i.e. Optimism) enabling fast bridging for assets between networks and generating fees for the Aave DAO.\n\nBeing L2 ready also led us to introduce Price Oracle Sentinel which introduces a grace period for liquidations and disables borrowing in case a threshold is met, i.e. but not limited to handling the downtime of a sequencer.\n\nV3 introduces the most exciting capital efficiency feature, the High Efficiency Mode (eMode). This new asset category management allows to maximise capital efficiency within the assets that correlate in value in the same category, i.e. borrow one stablecoin against another stablecoin as a category.\n\neMode also allows to introduce a specific oracle for a certain asset category.\n\nSimilarly liquidators and borrowers benefit form the new feature of the ability to repay your position with aTokens.\n\nCredit Delegation was adopted from V2 to V3 - which has interesting potential use-cases especially during low yield environments to allow suppliers to subscribe to a new risk profile without adding risk to the protocol.\n\nDecentralization has been also another focus area. V3 introduces asset listing admins, meaning that in the future various type of asset listing delegations could be added to list new assets (potentially even risk parameters governed by staking AAVE üëÄ).\n\nMost importantly, releases of the intuitive Aave UI is deployed on IPFS so anyone can truly access the protocol and various previous deployments.\n\nGiven that V3 has been successfully deployed and battle-tested across various markets - waiting with full excitement for the new deployment on the Ethereum market and providing users a seamless way to migrate positions between V2 to V3 to benefit from all the new features.\n\nI might have forgot some features (and obviously gas reductions) however, the key takeaway the flexibility V3 as an architecture provides and nothing such would be possible to build without having exceptional people at Aave. For more details head to the docs https://docs.aave.com/developers/getting-started/readme\n\n\u2028Hope this was helpful and insightful while waiting for V3 for Ethereum mainnet üëª",

      'Three interesting challenges I want to share from product building perspective that might help other fellow builders here on Lens\n\n1. What are you trying to solve?\n\nSerious question, especially for web3 products. Decentralization as a product, will only get you as far as the firm believers. To cross the line, how is your web3 product faster, better and stronger than anything else out there?\n\n2. Keep the product simple\n\n\n\nIt might be intuitive to think that feature rich products are what keep the users coming back. However, most successful products do start with a simple offering, focused to the main objective the product is solving. What is the main thing you want to solve with your product? How could you provide this utility with least friction and distraction? Once you get your product in a place where it has the most straighforward way to achieve its goal, you are in the right track. You often might hear the sentence "talk to your users", something that you hear from Y Combinator. Understanding what customers want and think about our product would help to achieve to build the parts that eventually makes your product feature rich, based on what are your users needs.\n\n2. Don\u0027t build everything at once\n\nStart with the main feature, what your product is built to solve in the first place. Less is more, and you are able to ship faster and iterate. Don\u0027t be afraid to ship shitty code or designs, its okay in the beginning but iterate to improve.',
