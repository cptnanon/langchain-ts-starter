PGN ended up running out of money and winding down but Sophia learned tons of lessons along the way about maintaining a blockchain that she shares with us in this episode.\n\nWe then did a deep dive into onchain funding - what new things it enables, why it‚Äôs important, and Sophia gives lots of examples of use cases or apps she would love to see get built out in the onchain funding arena.\n\nSophia was nominated by Nicole (by way of Triumph) and voted onto the podcast by Richie Bonilla, Andy Boyan, Meg Lister, David Phelps, Rachael Amy, and Triumph.\n\n\nüëú COLLECT THIS EPISODE: https://pods.media/rehash/s9-e5-is-public-goods-funding-sustainable-wsophia-dew-celo \n\nü§ù SUBSCRIBE TO REHASH PODCAST CLUB (RPC): https://hypersub.withfabric.xyz/s/rpc?referrer=0x4b65caf44055f910fd94eae4f14307ffe3233b12 \n\n\nüëã FOLLOW REHASH:\nTwitter: https://x.com/rehashweb3 \nWarpcast (Farcaster): https://warpcast.com/rehash \nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@rehashweb3 \nInstagram: https://instagram.com/rehashweb3 \nNewsletter: https://paragraph.xyz/@rehash \nRehash Podcast Club (RPC): https://hypersub.withfabric.xyz/collection/rehash-podcast-club-s9c8bb45vg1s?referrer=0x4b65caf44055f910fd94eae4f14307ffe3233b12 \nDiana Chen (Host): https://twitter.com/ddwchen \n\nüîó IMPORTANT LINKS:\nSohia‚Äôs Twitter: https://x.com/sodofi_ \nSophia‚Äôs Warpcast (Farcaster): https://warpcast.com/sophia \nCelo: https://celo.org/ \n\n \nDISCLAIMER: The information in this video is the opinion of the speaker(s) only and is for informational purposes only.

I'd fallen into the trap of trying to stay 'informed,' not realizing that the cost was becoming a passive spectator to the world's tragedies. \n\nThe algorithm trapped me in a low emotional state, constantly anticipating the next bad news. But I'd forgotten that the world begins within me and that while everyone has their place in life's cycle, the world is a collective projection we all sustain. So, I woke up early, meditated, and exercised for two hours to elevate my frequency as high as possible before starting my day. It's necessary to forget in order to remember. \n\nI created this with p5js as a consequence , I suggest to let yourself be hypnotized and elevated by this artifact. Don't try to understand with your logical mind what I'm trying to say. Deep down, words are superfluous; it's the invisible that sustains the world.\n\n10k $bonsai | 10% referral | 1/1",

I usually never have a problem with this, and have an audience on Twitter, and my Farcaster one seems to be growing too. \n\nI also find it quite hard to overcome the UX issues, especially around notifications. I find out 3-4 days after I posted who liked it, if im lucky and i usually have to check both Hey and Orb. Something is off there. \n\nAll in all - Orb feels lonely to me, and to peers that are just joining. A bit like when i first joined Twitter in 2010 or so.\n\nWe did an at home test, and my husband said the apps had wayy too many UX constraints for him to spend time on them - he's not a crypto native, so he also doesnt quite grasp the urge to dogfood and give feedback, but he was not convinced (and yes I did bribe him and took him out for dinner)",

This is different than traditional social media that owns your connections and doesnt offer a way out for your trad social graph.\n\nSecondly this was explicitly a commission - and of course, there is the open possibility of interacting with a new audience that can choose (or not) to support your work. So nobody is extracting here, again.\n\nThirdly, how the algorithm works - post quality content, get lots of engagement and some of them will be able to afford your art - bear in mind, this is a very global audience and not everyone thinks that \"just 20 usd\" is little money.

We are taking notes on your feedback on how you think clubs/channels should be implemented, as a part of the Lens Network feedback stream. We're reducing the rollout of protocol-specific features, as it creates a backlog on client teams and we're all heads down building with the network in mind.",

So far, I think building something where you can follow your friends on either protocol is one of the big things to get done to do this.\n\nThere are several cross posting clients i love, like @lens/yup_io @lens/ppl_\\_ - I still think that the audiences are so different that crossposting is not a great deal unless you got a banger. I post differently for every audience I have (but I work here, so i get this is a lot of work for enthusiasts)\n\nMeetups, seminars, learning sessions would be cool - we haven't been able to build a bridge there, and people seem to think that they need to pick a side. Just look at the blogposts on decentralized social, they seem to all casually forget the Lens logo!\n\nBesides that, there's the obvious need to grow the userbase for all of decentralized social. Lens does not want to do this alone - therefore independent clients are all invited (<https://dune.com/lens/lens-protocol)> and we got some interesting client diversity that we wanna preserve.\n\nMore integration of @lens/davidf's Open Frames so that they work on both Lens and FC would be great as well. Anyways just some thoughts, but tons of work and we're super open to people joining the mission.",

Sign-up through wallet + later signing up to lens feels overkill. I think implementing a Lens signup would be easier.\n\n3\\. Wallet signature prompt UX needs to be improved, it hid my main browser and there were big empty rectangles around before i could sign on wallet (im on metamask and firefox)\n\n4\\. Good game selection, I enjoyed it. Among us crashes unfortunately, so my highest scores couldnt be shared.\n\nEncouraging everyone to test @lens/libree and sending them feedback! it's fun!",

    "pageContent": "Omg time for a professional announcement!\nI‚Äôve joined @lens/avara  to work in Growth :) \n\nI‚Äôm on my lane, moisturised, focused and as I like it best, onchain. So very lucky to be able to join @lens/stani  @lens/paris  @lens/christina  and so many hyper talented people.\n\nI want to share a couple things that I think are useful from my journey - finding the right fit after years as a founder and as a generalist, was way harder than I thought it would be. I learned a lot and it was a humbling experience.\n\nThis is the most LinkedIn thing you‚Äôll ever read from me and I‚Äôll go back asap to my usual stunts.\n\n\n\nStarting a company (JPG), growing it and winding it down was a whole incredible experience. I have gained invaluable knowledge and finally got to understand a completely different language and way of building than those I was used to from my previous work experience.¬†\n\n\n\nSpeaking the language of venture, understanding how tech is built and why experiments matter. Why failing is celebrated (I did not understand this before!), and how to move around the venture industry was all new to me. I liked it all. I came out of this experience smarter, quicker and more creative than ever.¬†\n\nBut then I had to decide what to do next - starting a new thing was not an option: with so much incredible and ambitious tech being built around me, I felt I would be more useful contributing to an existing project.¬†\n\n\n\nAnd then, a new crash course: by interviewing and researching 20+ companies, I learned a lot about the current state of the crypto industry‚Äôs culture and I understood that I was totally behind, and that reinsertion would be challenging to say the least.¬†\n\n\n\nSo I got lucky. @lens/paris  reached out with an idea of what @lens/avara needed, and I was the person for the job. @lens/stani  had been an investor in JPG, and of course, I‚Äôve seen Avara in all its eras, so it looked like a perfect match for me. I also got to know @lens/christina along the way and felt like I was able to add value in every conversation, instead of repeating some canned introduction about myself like a parrot. All of that made any questions about not being my own boss anymore dissipate :)\n\n\n\nAnd of course, I‚Äôm picky - I wanted my next stage to be big. I‚Äôm an @lens/aave user, a staker, a degen, a farmer so joining the company that spearheads the building of the premier DeFi platform made a ton of sense to me. And observing the elegance of the architecture behind @lens/lens really cemented the rest of the deal. I‚Äôm excited I get to be part of a great team, with outstanding tech behind it, and one of the best track records in the industry that I‚Äôve dedicated my career to.¬†\n\n\n\nOne final thing - I‚Äôm really trying to figure out how to optimise brands and make them leverage decentralised social, and solve creators‚Äô pain points to migrate their business + socials to @lens/lens ¬†\n\nSo in the coming weeks, I‚Äôll be offering free advice to all brands + creators wanting to share their challenges with me, and brainstorm how to build communities and brands on Lens.

During our 2018 hackathon, a group of hackers I really admired (that now I call friends) hacked together the G√∂rli Testnet, and won the main prize. \nBut a few days later, we realized they had accidentally broken the rules, and with all the pain in my heart, I met with them to tell them we had to disqualify them. But we wanted to do more for them, we believed in the testnet, so we decided to support them to launch it, and the testnet became a part of Department of Decentralization. We secured grants to bootstrap the development, threw it a conference for its launch, and I became one of the human faucets and community mods. \nI was the faucet until early 2022, when Swarm launched an initiative to use their testnet (buily on Goerli) and incentivize people. Then the real faucets got drained all the time and we were struggling to top them up. \nSo eventually most of us gave up and the devs set up to migrate to Sepolia.\nThis is where LayerZero decided to create a two way bridge for people to buy Goerli ETH. And people started selling their testnet Eth for ETH. This had happened before, but the bridges never got enough liquidity so they died down. This one didn‚Äôt. \nI was traveling and a friend dmd me saying people were finding my ens and realizing i was a goerli whale. It was too late to sink down the goerli price, it had reached 1 USD (then it dumped quickly). Plus LayerZero is a big project and I did not want my reputation screwed up so the least of any evil was to dump‚Ä¶. The 5 million goerli eth i had. I tested with 10 eth, boarded a flight and when i landed my phone was a notifications disaster with trolls all over. I got really angry at the trolls, dumped 50 ETH (nobody should harass me or anybody!) and donated the proceeds via Endaoment. During a whole week, I dumped all my goerli eth in the market and donated to different places (kept a bit for my troubles - im not stupid).\n\n‚Ä¶ and im still not elligible.",

    "pageContent": "Hey everyone please #LMCC! I made some new improvements on illustrating LIP-29, which aims to decentralize a User's algorithm by creating a free-market that's regulated by the users preferences. This works by establishing a \"User Owned Algorithm\" or \"UOA\" for short which is an NFT that has metadata containing the user's preferred algorithm. This UOA is read by apps in order to allow a user to have a say in what they see. This say or \"preference\" is expressed in two ways. One way is the User's profiles data from interactions that can be queried on Lens Protocol. This data is fed to the additional way that users curate what they see by choosing an \"Agent.\" An agent determines what is included in an algorithm based on the users preferences coupled with the agents curation. In addition, the agent can hold \"auctions\" for any kind of ads that the user opts to include in their feed, or it can hold \"auctions\" on how much the user is willing to pay for similar paid content they want to include like news companies, sports, ext. The party interacting with the agent is called a \"third party algorithm provider,\" whose role is to curate and bid at agents auctions. This interaction between agents and 3rd parties is meant to decentralize algorithm production and provide users with the cheapest and best content.\n\nNow, when a user makes a post, that post can then be picked up by third party algorithm generator that then that post is either included or excluded by an agent. And, a user can always \"force include\" a profile though their social graph or some other mechanism by added it in a manual way to the UOA in any case of censorship attacks.\n\nHere are diagrams of both scenarios:",

Having incentived workshops yk free profiles + $5 or whatever would be a much better allocation of resources and then redirecting that energy into web3 native growth would yield a better expected value. I‚Äôve never been on the perspective of running a social app/protocol to be fair, this may be a play that looks bad but has other impacts. Such as just looking alive. However, from a user/social media manager perspective it comes off as theatrical when the people highlighted or put in spotlight are not community based creators (of which there‚Äôs at least 1k is my estimate). However, that is also a benefit as you basically get to rent these more experienced people until you have a better crop in house, so long as you don‚Äôt overextend. This is probably the most critical view I hold and everyone knows I hold it lol. Mostly because it ends in the not spotlighted group feeling burnt and then once the rotation happens as you see in every developing social app that takes this strategy‚Ä¶ the people you highlighted feel used and thrown out as trash even though it was more or less a free handout. Which can go south depending on if the spotlight group generates a lot of dramatic PR as backlash, but it is what it is man!

All of these are the ingredients to an algorithm, but not the algorithm itself. Meaning, apps still own what you see and how you see it creating a centralization vector. By creating a readable NFT inscribed with the metadata of your algorithm (user owned algorithm) the user now has more ownership over their social. This strengthens a users ‚Äúliquid citizenship‚Äù by reducing barriers between switching clients. Then, creating a market how the metadata in a UOA is built provides more value to the user. Using an agent and a 3rd party dynamic is basically PBS but for algorithm curation where the agent proposes the best content to the user as a product of content created by 3rd party ‚Äúbuilders‚Äù. This completely opens the market of advertising from out of band payments to apps to a market that anyone can use to propagate content. Example would be an up and coming artist paying a 3rd party to distribute their music to new listeners for a much better price then buying an ad on FB. It also gives the user ‚Äúveto‚Äù power on what they see, so if they want an ad free feed, they can have it.",

The ‚Äúeasier‚Äù ways of doing this such as having a app just generate an algorithm is a centralization vector. Having the user own their algorithm curation allows them to freely move between front ends without the hinderance of losing their algorithm. Take the example of TikTok‚Äôs algo, most users would rather probably be on another platform, but because they would lose their feed, they stay on an extractive app.",

Lens Protocol V1 and V2 are deployed on Polygon. V1 and V2 run on a single chain (network) and have no cross-chain features.\n\nWhen we say \"V3\" we're talking about Lens Protocol V3. It expected to launch on Lens Network, instead of Polygon, but isn't specifically related to Lens Network. It's simply an updated set of smart contracts. V3 *will *reportedly have cross-chain features, allowing the Protocol running on Lens Network to be a central hub for any instance of Lens Protocol V3 running on any other chain. It's currently unclear whether the cross-chain features will be available at launch.\n\nIn short:\n\n\"Network\" = blockchain\n\n\"Protocol\" = smart contracts\n\nI suspect this will be confusing for most people, and perhaps the team should consider renaming one of them. As far as them happening at the same time, that's unclear, but it's my assumption that Lens Protocol V3 will launch on Lens Network (not Polygon), which means the chain has to be up and running first. If I had to guess, I'd imagine that we'll first see a Lens Network testnet launch followed by a V3 deployed on that testnet. It's also possible that Lens Protocol V3 is first deployed on Polygon testnet (amoy), before Lens Network is ready.",

    "pageContent": "**Frames Kinda Suck (But They Don‚Äôt Have To)**\n\nIt‚Äôs cool to see Lens Frames being supported by more apps, but I fear that the hype around Frames has passed, and now we‚Äôre stuck in *the trough* with a user experience that kind of sucks.\n\n**The Good**\n\nFrames allow for some interesting use cases, effectively turning links into interactive mini-apps. This is especially interesting when combined with onchain activity, like using Open Actions, and passive games.\n\nFrames are built on the Open Graph meta tags system. This is something you‚Äôve likely seen in many social apps ‚Äî it‚Äôs those website preview images that are automatically shown when a post or message contains a link. Frames extend that format to allow for actual interactions; essentially adding buttons to those link *embeds*.\n\nThere are many benefits to supporting Frames, like reducing the need to leave the feed, associating the interactions with a user‚Äôs social graph, and removing some friction of interacting directly with smart contracts.\n\n**The Bad**\n\nThe problem is they‚Äôre really slow to use and generally have poor UX design. Frames break most best practices when it comes to web design. A Frame can show up to four buttons and a single input field. These buttons have no visual indication of their importance, danger, or relevance to the content. They‚Äôre generally visually identical. The input fields aren‚Äôt capable of providing basic niceties that you‚Äôve come to expect, like autocomplete, validation, and suggestions.\n\nThere‚Äôs no concept of navigation or history in Frames. You can‚Äôt simply go ‚Äúback‚Äù to see a previous Frame, or refresh the current Frame unless one (or more) of the 4 buttons is dedicated to navigation. This breaks typical expectations in using web interfaces and forces the Frame to use the limited real estate for adding basic functions.\n\nOne of the biggest issues with Open Graph tags, in general, is that most apps download the entire HTML document, then parse for the tags. This can be fairly slow and is terribly inefficient. For instance, just the HTML for a single YouTube video page is close to a 1MB download. Add a few of those to a feed and their impact becomes noticeable. For this reason, apps typically cache Open Graph tags to cut down the load times. Unfortunately, caching isn‚Äôt always possible with Frames because the images are often dynamic.\n\nAnother huge limitation for Frames is the necessity to present the UI as an image. This is terrible for accessibility, an inefficient use of resources, and reminds me of the worst aspects of the Flash days.\n\n**The Solutions**\n\nFor starters, Frame UIs should have built-in navigation and history stack. It shouldn‚Äôt be up to the Frame to provide basic affordances like ‚Äúback‚Äù and ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù.\n\nFrame buttons should allow for classification and denoting importance. *Dangerous* actions shouldn‚Äôt look the same as safe ones, and primary actions shouldn‚Äôt look the same as secondary or tertiary actions.\n\nApps that show Frames should use ‚Äústreaming‚Äù to download only the header of an HTML document, rather than downloading the entire thing and then parsing. This is a basic feature supported by the standard Javascript library for making web calls (`fetch`). In my limited testing it‚Äôs 5 - 10x faster.\n\nLastly, we need UI kits that standardize the way UIs are built in Frame images, and standards for accessibility so things like screen readers work with Frames. This would make it much easier for developers to present interfaces in a way that is familiar and expected.",

This lead me to run an NFT fund from 2021-2023.\n\nI strongly believe that for crypto technology to truly reach its full potential, it must be made hyper accessible, which inspired me to launch the 'Context' podcast with @lens/boysclub. The goal is to highlight how crypto intersects with cultural applications including art, music and fashion\"\n\n**What type of content do you create? How do you come up with ideas for your content?**\n\n\"I create audio content through my podcasts and short form videos which support and further explore the ideas I discuss on my podcast.\n\nI also have my /context group on @lens/orb where I post all my videos as well as other thoughts/photos/updates around the topics I cover on my pod.\"\n\n<https://orb.club/c/context>\n\n**What's been your experience with Bonsai?**\n\n\"I've loved it so far! I've used it primarily to buy art on @lens/orb. I genuinely think that Orb is home to some of the most experimental and interesting artists working with crypto right now, so that's been exciting to be apart of.\n\nI want to further exlpore the minting mechanic on Orb for some of my content, in particular my videos and long form writing.\"\n\n**What do you have going these days?**\n\n\"I am releasing the next episode of the pod to mint featuring Nina Chanel Abney, who was the first (and maybe only!) artist to be part of the Punk in Residence Program with CryptoPunks.\n\nThe reception of her Punk project was very polarizing and its the first time she is talking about her experience working with CryptoPunks publicly on a podcast.\"\n\n<https://pods.media/context/context-s3-inside-super-punk-world-w-nina-chanel-abney-and-todd-kramer>\n\nMake sure to follow @lens/blakefinucane, /context and mint her new podcast episode üå≥",

Like if it costs more to build a cathedral because you have to pay people a living wage, why wouldn‚Äôt you take the care to design something better?\n\nI now have to spend my whole day puzzled by this because I am more than lost now. Catholics have an answer for this, as the free labor could have been passionate followers of the faith. \n\nEven in the US most old government buildings were built by slaves, Involuntary Servants, and yet the White House, Capitol Hill & many monuments remain beautiful. Why? Why did we stop? Why did slaves put so much care into laying marble at the floor of the Tennesse Capitol Building? For the very men who beat them? I have to ponder it.",

I strapped him to my chest and we worked all day long and watched an Alabama Football Game, to which we both fell asleep to.\n\nToday I was hands off. We have been practicing with playdoh. Over time he has learned. Today he showed me he was ready to be here by himself. Furthermore, he didn‚Äôt need me. He worked it himself and the tortilla he made, he is eating. He did need me for one thing. He wanted to make sure I liked it.\n\nBeing a dad is crazy man. I‚Äôm cutting onions right now so I‚Äôm not crying.",

I was up in Oregon for wedding / family / grandma's funeral, and now in San Francisco for another wedding. I flew in on Wednesday. Full banger top to bottom catching up with friends and family. It's been really fun.\n\nWith all that movement, I dropped off my rig at my folks house, packed up all my stuff into a few bags, and getting ready for my next steps back in NYC. Stoked!\n\n**Weekly Recap:**\n\n-Kicking it with my parents and painting with my mom. The best :)\n\n-On Tuesday, I had a Twitter Space with Transient Labs on their product T.R.A.C.E. I've been working with them over a year now with all my fine art and was super fun to caht about their digital COA and how I use them on all my paintings.\n\n-I've been on the hunt for a new studio space in Brooklyn. Found a cool one that I'll be checking out on Tuesday. Def need something soon as I have a bunch of fun commissions in the works.\n\n-I got invited to a few new group shows that will be in September and in Decemeber. More details on those as I get more info to share out.\n\n-I got some amazing photos from my painting 'Montauk'. Such a beautiful environment and photo up on NYC.\n\nHuge shoutout to @lens/aftereditions @lens/dylan_farrell_design @lens/fillinglobal\n\n**What's next?**\n\n-Weddings bay-bee! Excited to celebrate my friends wedding just outside of SF this weekend. After that, I fly to NYC on Sunday and will be getting settled in. From there, prepping for commissions and pushing on my indo series. \n\nI've been moving around so much these past few weeks, I'm looking forward to chilling out and getting into production.\n\nHave a wonderful weekend friends :)\n\n-Alimo",

    "pageContent": "You've all seen the reels of luxury watch negotiations. We all know the secondary market for various goods fuels all kinds of models and experiences...\n\nDo you think we could see something like a concierge service for RWAs, NFTs, and other such collectibles? üßµüëáüèæ\n\nConcierge services are a staple in the world of luxury items, offering personalized assistance for watches, bags, and other high-end clothing. However, a noticeable gap exists when it comes to more niche collectibles such as Pok√©mon Cards, sports memorabilia, and even NFTs.\n\nDespite their label as \"niche,\" the collector bases for these items are enormous, and the values of the collectibles can rival those of luxury watches or designer bags. This raises an important question: Why isn't there a concierge service for these niche collectibles?\n\nThe advantages of a concierge service are clear. It saves time, potentially saves money, and provides comfort through the assurance that experts are helping you find exactly what you‚Äôre looking for. In the bustling world of collectibles, where finding a rare item can be akin to searching for a needle in a haystack, such services could revolutionize how collectors engage with the market.\n\nNot every collector has the time or expertise to sift through the figurative box of slabs to uncover the gems they desire. Moreover, as different collectibles ebb and flow in popularity and value, the need for specialized support becomes even more pronounced.\n\nWe are likely on the cusp of seeing more concierge services emerge, focused specifically on these niche markets. Such services would not only elevate the collecting experience but also enhance the overall market for buyers and sellers alike by ensuring quality and authenticity.\nAs the landscape of collecting evolves, the expansion of concierge services to include niche collectibles isn't just a luxury‚Äîit's a necessary evolution. \n\nThis could be the next big wave in collector services, bringing sophisticated, personalized assistance to a market that's ripe for transformation.\n\nAs part of my side-quest to become a professional Pok√©mon TCG player, I've found myself deep in the world of trading these RWAs...and looking to explore it further with: MINT AND CRISPY  ‚ú®  \n\n If you're interested in the journey, give us a follow‚úåüèæ\n\nhttps://x.com/mintandcrispy\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/mintandcrispy/",

Yet, despite the clear benefits, its adoption faces hurdles. Why is that? ü§î\n\nTake Courtyard for example: This platform has redefined collecting Pok√©mon cards and other collectibles using blockchain technology, offering a secure, risk-free way to trade and manage your collection.\n\nWith Courtyard, you can start your collection for as little as $25, with a buyback guarantee. It means zero risk for newbies and secure investment for veterans üöÄ\n\nSecurity is paramount in collectibles. Each card on Courtyard is protected by Brink's, ensuring that your assets are safe against fraud while allowing easy transfers and salesüõ°Ô∏è\n\nMore interestingly, if you already own collectibles, you can tokenize them on Courtyard. This converts your physical items into digital assets that are easier to manage, trade, and even earn from üí∏\n\nBut despite these advantages, broader adoption across the RWA space is slow. Perhaps a significant barrier is simply a lack of awareness about what can be done with tokenized assets in the DeFi ecosystem üöß\n\nWhat can be done to improve this? Firstly, the UX around tokenization has massively improved and is relatively optimized for adoption. However, we need a similar experience for accessing DeFi products with these tokenized assets and a variety of actions that can be performed with such assets.\n\nSecondly, education and content are king. We need more quality content that speaks directly to niche collector communities, showing them the benefits and possibilities of tokenization üé•\n\nFor instance, in the Pok√©mon collecting community, there is huge potential to integrate educational content into the already vibrant culture of card trading and collecting. Moreover, this could be achieved on many platforms, especially niche-specific ones like Whatnot.\n\nRome wasn‚Äôt built in a day, and it won‚Äôt take just one day for tokenization to become a staple in collector communities either. The benefits are clear; we just need to tap into niche creators and communities and enable them to amplify the benefits of tokenization as the space makes it easier for collectors to do more with their tokenized assets üí≠",

But what do you get in return?¬†\n\nWith Lens, you get the features to control how you monetize, split your revenue, and how you grow and manage your social graph.¬†¬†Why does this matter?¬†\n\nNFTs are narrative-driven, ever-changing, and above all, subject to market conditions. For instance, NFTs now are being described as a distribution strategy ‚Äî which is different from how we spoke about them before and without the record-breaking sales of previous cycles. Creators in the NFT space have felt the brunt of these narrative changes ‚Äì from royalty removals to the open-edition mint eclipsing 1-of-1 NFTs.\n\nWith Lens, all features are built with the vision of a user-owned internet in mind. Builders get the flexibility of picking and choosing features, no matter the current obsession or narrative.¬†\n\nCollectibles, publications, profiles, handles, collects ‚Äì all are customizable.¬†\n\nSo you might be asking, why trust Lens over what everyone else does? The simple answer is: you shouldn't. You should verify. Read our docs. Ask your technical friends. See for yourself :)\n\nhttps://www.lens.xyz/docs",

Mind you this is a public place requiring tour guide at all times and it is LITTERED with humans. Finding solace in a place like this is near impossible. When I was on tour with Buddy we had a 3 day gap between Austin and Phoenix. There‚Äôs a lot of empty space between these two cities and honestly, being from Phoenix, not a lot to do there for 3 days. I pitched the idea of heading northwest through Albuquerque and into Arizona from near the four corners so that we could do some nature sightseeing - Antelope Canyon in Page and then stay overnight at the Grand Canyon, which had snow in the forecast. I made a deck with imagery for the artists (Buddy and Boogie) to approve since it‚Äôs their money being spent to travel and they concurred. Now we have 2 rappers and their DJs, a driver, a tour manager, and myself loaded up on some mad max truck into the desert to wander through these canyon walls. The famous sand waterfall ledge is being played with constantly for everyone to get a shot of it by itself, but we had the idea to tagteam the operation and make this happen. Luckily we had the area clear by being stubborn assholes to the other tourists and nailed it. While he‚Äôs wearing this visor with guy fieri hair for a character he liked to call Derrick lol. No one has ever seen this image before, by the way (: \n\n@lens/orb @lens/bonsai @lens/lens #7365 \n@lens/creators @lens/photographers #GRAMSDIDIT",

    "pageContent": "Bonsai Token is going cross-chain, and I wanted to shed some light on how we‚Äôre thinking about it.\n\n\\* **how?** using the OFT standard from @lens/layerzero_labs\n\n\\* **where?** where onchain activity and strong communities are\n\n\\* **why?** extend the $BONSAI token network for the creator economy across chains\n\nTLDR; we believe $BONSAI could be the first cross-chain token network to achieve the viral flywheel effect with monetization/rewards/incentives\n\n**Bonsai OFT**\n\nThe OFT standard from LayerZero allows¬†tokens¬†to be transferred across chains without wrapping or third-party bridges. This means Bonsai Token will be supported on any EVM chain, and you can swap across them fast & cheap. We will host a bridge interface on the Bonsai website, and users of Stargate can bridge $BONSAI there too.\n\n**Which chains are we looking to support?**\n\nTo decide which chains we‚Äôre focusing our efforts on - beyond @lens/zksync & Lens Network - we‚Äôre looking at where there‚Äôs trading volume, relevant onchain activity, and strong communities.\n\nOn the Lens Network, we anticipate that $BONSAI will remain the preferred currency for creators, enabling them to earn through various crypto social avenues. Whether it‚Äôs via collectible content, premium feeds, or innovative SocialFi open actions / frames - $BONSAI is set to be at the forefront of the creator economy.\n\nAs the zkSync Elastic Chain grows and more users are brought onchain - I expect the\n\n@lens/lens social graph and $BONSAI token network to grow with it.\n\nIf we take a look at @lens/base - the majority of trading activity for Uniswap is happening there. Just this week, they shared a chart of the weekly Univ2 pairs. Base has 4.5x the pools that Ethereum has, and 170x the pools that Polygon has.\n\nBase also boasts some of the strongest memecoin communities, including BasedBrett and $HIGHER. I‚Äôd personally love to find out what a Bonsai x Higher collab would look like, in terms of creative output.\n\n**Why is Bonsai going cross-chain?**\n\nOn Lens, creators have been using $BONSAI to monetize their content and creative output. Users, curators and Orb Clubs are also able to earn their cut on referral fees. We could just migrate to zkSync / Lens Network and stop there. But as we see it, $BONSAI is already the de-facto culture currency in our ecosystem - and it would be more interesting for us to tap other onchain communities where they already are. And that‚Äôs currently on Base.\n\nWith apps like Boost and Layer3 - we‚Äôre able to use token incentives to help push mints to go viral onchain. Currently, creators like @lens/levy and those part of the BluePrint cohort are using $BONSAI to drive their mints on platforms like Pods & Zora.\n\nIf $BONSAI was also on Base, the collectors who redeemed those rewards could immediately spend them on other creators in the ecosystem. The flywheel effect we‚Äôre looking to achieve here is 1) earn tokens 2) spend them on creators 3) drive economic activity 4) earn tokens. Bonsai Token could be the first cross-chain token network to achieve this flywheel effect at scale across the onchain creator economy.\n\nI think $DEGEN dropped the ball on being the culture currency for Base. They were too focused on the L3, rather than expanding on what was already working for them - tipping content on Farcaster. Tipping for the sake of tipping is not really interesting anymore.\n\nI like the Club Treasury feature from @lens/orb to collectively earn & re-distribute tokens. It‚Äôs one step away from a DAO, and empowering them with a cross-chain culture currency like $BONSAI would enable them to participate in any onchain economy.\n\nAll this to say - I‚Äôm excited for this cross-chain future that‚Äôs coming for Bonsai. It won‚Äôt come without its hurdles, but it will be totally worth it in the long term.",

Help us get into the top 10!\n\nOne of the biggest takeaways from last week's music tech conference is that people don't know what's possible with AI or Blockchain and they're not being provided the opportunity to learn or figure it out. That's why this edition of Metaversit√© feels more important than ever. I would say this sentiment stretches beyond music to many industries, especially in the creative sector.\n\nIf you want to support the online and Stockholm sessions this Spring, you can tip this post or collect one of the project artifacts for .001 ETH -  https.//artizen.fund/project/metaversite. \n\nEvery collection is matched by at least double and helps us expand the scale of what we're able to accomplish. We've mapped out XS, S, M, and L versions of this next session.\n\nWhat do you think? Do we need more programs to onboarding people to emerging tech like AI and Blockchain?",

I was so frustrated that I could be so good at so many things but couldn't create art. But my imagination! I was devastated.\n\nFlash forward to today- when I create a text prompt that's 20 years of art history, reference, and understanding of language. Countless hours on film sets and in-class learning history and technique, how to frame the shot, and how to express emotion in the most nuanced of ways. Weekdays and weeknights experiencing the vibrancy and beauty of human culture in all its forms. My imagination has waited a lifetime for this moment. And that I get to pair it with my musical work is nothing short of spectacular.\n\n\nCan't wait to keep building, exploring, creating, visualizing, and helping others to more deeply understand and leverage this moment, bit by bit. In the words of another timeless Sondheim Musical, \"Sunday in the Park with George,\"\n\n\n‚ÄúBit by bit, putting it together...\nPiece by piece, only way to make a work of art.\nEvery moment makes a contribution,\nEvery little detail plays a part.\nHaving just the vision's no solution,\nEverything depends on execution,\nPutting it together, that's what counts.‚Äù\n\n\n1 Matic /Edition of 25",

    "pageContent": "Music is a funny thing. You can start a project and end up somewhere completely different then you intended. That's the story of \"Provenance.\" ORIGINST√òRY was supposed to be a dance project but as I unpacked my truth the music came in a different direction. This track is important for many reasons though. It is a reclamation of my beginnings, an RIP to shame and a celebration of my ancestors. I'm a descendant of American slaves which means I do not truly know where I'm from (yes a DNA test can attempt to geo-locate, but its not the origin story. It's something that always hurt to acknowledge, especially when sharing this with people who can easily trace their origins. However to find the origin I turn to 1619 and the Bay of Campeche. From a kidnapped pirate ship the first slaves arrived to America. When these slaves touched water in the Bay of Campeche they became American. This new multi-hyphenated people have struggled and survived hardship and cruelty, erasure, and degradation. Yet still they rise. From the darkest moments of history they have achieved greatness and excelled in more ways than can ever be counted. Society has taught us to shame this moment, but from this darkness there is empowerment, catharsis, and closure. When people ask me where I'm from I can always hold my head knowing that I am the descendant of Kings and Queens who survived one of the cruelest moments in history. And today I celebrate my freedom as an expatriate carving my own path. It doesn't matter where you come from, you can be a superhero. Now dance baby because, \"it's not you it's the city it's a jungle, take me back, take it back, back.\"\n\nproduced w/the homie David Gumm",

    "pageContent": "Three years ago, pre-pandemic I was on the endless musician hustle. It was draining me and I felt relieved to have a pause and to get off the train that felt like it was always moving, but headed nowhere. Two years ago after many late nights on Clubhouse, I made a business plan centered around the new opportunities I saw possible thanks to Blockchain and NFTs.  Flash forward to today and I'm founding a DAO that upholds some of these initial ideas and an AI company helping to get tools into the hand of creators.  \n\nA year ago I decided to go full Nomad, and it has been nothing short of inspiring. It feels like I've been in a master's class and in addition to a newfound passion for product development I've finally been inspired to get back into making music.  But where I've ended up is not where I thought I would in terms of sound. I've always loved all types of music but as I began my career there was so much focus on developing my authentic voice. I thought I found that was house music, but the more I've dived in deep these past six months, I realized that I don't want to be bound by genre. \n\nThat's part of the reason I haven't been releasing new music. I've been writing and visualizing what this next musical moment holds, and now that it's almost time to share this project, I feel so grateful to have the power of creative AI to help me share a more complete and more personal version of the world that's inside my head. I'm on the fence about if I want to change my artist name now because the past two years have empowered me to believe in myself again and the ability I have to make an impact both on and off the record. I'm so excited for this next chapter and working on how to bridge my pre-Web3 and post-Web3 music personas. An interesting challenge awaits, but I'm ready for it and to share it with you!  Below you'll find a snippet from the original plan and an image I imagined as part of one of the songs on the project. I grew up in a Texas suburb and my parents had this vintage white Mercedes-Benz we would take on road trips. The way the light hits in this image fills me with memory and nostalgia for the simple days of childhood.\n\nHere's to the future! Whatever it may hold üôå\n\n",

At least we made the most of it and ate 99-cent pizza on the streets of NYC after, belly laughs included. Would be amazing if there was a way to connect with the audience that was there that night, but audience data is always gated from artists, especially during \"exposure\" experiences.

    "pageContent": "Before we get going, a little backstory.\n\n\nORIGINST√òRY was supposed to be a dance music project.\n\n\nAt the end of 2019, my friends helped me pick this new artist's name (while sipping G&T's and looking out at the Christmas tree standing proudly in a cozy Stockholm square).  2020 was going to be my year. I'd just come off a successful tour, had learned to deal with my inner saboteur and had offers coming in daily. The pandemic hit hard for everyone and in the middle of it while trying to figure out the next move I found myself in the midst of depression and self-doubt. I quit music and didn't see a road back. But slowly, slowly around the middle of 2022 I started to find joy in creating again. I just let it flow, tried not to judge the process, and be open.  The rapid ascent of creative AI also gave me another tool, something I'd hoped for since childhood, but had given up on - the ability to create artistic scenes composed of the images and ideas in my mind.\n\n\nFlash forward to today and the ORIGINST√òRY project has become rock and funk focused, filled with homages to the sounds that blasted from my childhood bedroom. It's not what I was expecting, but it couldn't be more appropriate. It was made for speakers, made for headphones, and definitely made for live.\n\n\nThis is a completely new adventure for me filled with all of the excitement and nerves of sharing yourself with the world for the first time. My hope in releasing this project into the Web3 world is that it might allow me to achieve dreams that I couldn't before.  I've seen so many wins for others in this space, I can't help but manifest some of that for myself and for the future. And I'm excited to see who joins along for the ride. I aim to push through this next chapter and to finally unveil my truest self.\n\nThe prologue of this project \"Provenance\" is a dance track and it's important because it is filled with my awe and wonder for a world I only discovered because the world came to a halt. Here's to new beginnings xo Sean Bradford / ORIGINST√òRY üéà",

Most people don‚Äôt understand these difference and part of the issue in ‚ÄúNFT‚Äù art is there‚Äôs no curatorial eyes helping or guiding what‚Äôs at least standard outside of blockchain.\n\n\nElectronic for me makes more since for this because as a producer you‚Äôd usually post to SoundCloud and have no option to monetize, but I‚Äôm not sure if this works across all genres. I also think we should stop thinking about ‚Äúfans‚Äù and more about ‚Äúaudience‚Äù the pressure to deliver to fans in music has created a toxicity , harmful, and unsafe environment for many artists.",
